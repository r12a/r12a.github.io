  <p><b class="leadin">Terminology.</b> The names of letters and diacritics with a particular function (and location relative to the beginning of the code block) are largely standardised in Unicode across all the Indic code charts. For example, although the 'vowel killer' diacritic may be called a 'pulli' in Tamil, it is still referred to by the Unicode character names as a 'virama'. In order to simplify the explanations and show better the commonality between the scripts, we will use the generic names for characters provided by Unicode. In addition, when it is occasionally necessary to refer to a specific letter by name, part of the Unicode name will be used in upper case.</p>

<div class="section"> 
			<p>This article provides an introduction to the major Indic scripts used on the Indian mainland. Those addressed in this paper include
				specifically Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, and Telugu.</p>
			<p class="noprint">The Indic examples are represented by graphics, to ensure that you see what is expected regardless of any fonts and rendering algorithms that are lacking on your system.  Unless you have disabled JavaScript, you can see a list of the characters represented in any graphic by clicking on it. You will also be presented with a text version of the characters in the graphic, which may or may not display correctly depending on whether your system has the right fonts and rendering algorithms. This information will pop up from the bottom right of your browser window. You can try it now by clicking on the following: <img src="images/hinxdi.png" class="ex" alt="हिंदी" /></p>
			<p class="noprint">Free fonts can be obtained from the Web for most scripts. For the phonetic transcriptions I recommend downloading the free Doulos SIL font.</p>
<p>Although the Indic scripts are often described as similar there is a large amount of variation at the detailed implementation level. To
				provide a detailed account of how each Indic script implements particular features on a letter by letter basis would require too much time and space
				for the task at hand. Nevertheless, despite the  variations at the detailed level, the basic mechanisms are to a large extent the same, and at the general level
				there <em>is</em> a great deal of similarity between these scripts. It is certainly possible to structure a discussion of the relevant features along
				the same lines for each of the scripts in the set. It is these common themes that this discussion will attempt to highlight, although we will also point out one or two of the differences along the way.
</p>
			<p>After some historical and phonetic background, we will tackle the subject in two parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> 
					<p>In the first part  I will survey the <em>visual characteristics</em> of these scripts.</p>
				</li>
				<li> 
					<p>In the second part I will make brief reference to some of the <em>practical ways those characteristics are supported using
						Unicode</em>.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="section"> 

			<h2><a id="history" name="history">Historical background</a></h2>
			<p>The similarity of features across all these scripts is not surprising if you consider their history. As shown in the illustration below,
				they all derive from a common ancestor. Note also that these scripts are used for two distinct major linguistic groups, Indo-European languages in
				the north, and Dravidian languages in the south.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/nna-derivation.gif"

				Writing Systems</em>.)</p>

			<h2><a id="sounds" name="sounds">Sounds of Indic languages</a></h2>
			<p>One of the defining aspects of a script is the repertoire of sounds it has to support. Because there is typically a letter for each of
				the phonemes in an Indic language, the alphabet tends to be quite large. The table below shows a superset of Indic consonant sounds in a traditional
				articulatory arrangement. It is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, so as to give you an idea of the number of sounds most Indic scripts
				must support. It does not include all sounds, for example a number of Dravidian alveolar sounds are not shown. The table also provides an
				<em>approximate</em> idea of how Unicode character names map to actual sounds, though it has to be stressed that this is only very approximate. The
				IPA transcription is shown to the left, followed by the standard Unicode name for that sound. Note the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>retroflex variants of a basic sound are found in most Indian languages,</li>
				<li>a plosive sound typically has an aspirated and unaspirated version,</li>
				<li>many languages also recognise one or more combinations as a single unit for sorting or other purposes, eg. <span
					class="ipa">kʃ</span>,</li>
				<li>it is common for consonant sounds in particular locations to be held for longer than usual (or in the case of plosives, slightly
					delayed) - these <em>geminated consonants</em> are typically shown by writing two consonants together, although the actual visual appearance can
					become quite complicated (this is described in more detail later).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>There are up to 18 Unicode code points dedicated to vowels in each script block, although fewer than this are actually needed on a per
				language basis. Nearly always these are simple vowel sounds, although occasionally a symbol may represent a diphthong (especially AI and AU). The
			  Unicode names for the whole list are:</p>
			<blockquote class="block-indent"> 
				<p>A, AA, I, II, U, UU, VOCALIC R, VOCALIC L, CANDRA E, SHORT E, E, AI, CANDRA O, SHORT O, O, AU, VOCALIC RR, VOCALIC LL</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Indic languages are syllabic in nature, and the <em>inherent vowel</em> is an important concept (see below). Unless otherwise indicated,
				each consonant is typically followed by this vowel sound. The inherent vowel can vary in pronunciation from script to script, and examples include
				<span class="ipa">ə</span>, <span class="ipa">ʌ</span>, and <span class="ipa">ɔ</span>.</p>
<!--<p>The next table shows the superset of vowel sounds.  There is somewhat more variation in the pronunciation of vowels than for consonants, and mere examples of pronunciation have been shown here.  Generally speaking these are simple vowel sounds, although in a small number of cases a script may treat a few sounds as diphthongs.</p>

			<p>Nasalisation of vowels is also an important phonetic feature that affects the written form of several South Asian languages. The effect
				is similar to the nasalisation of words like 'en' in French.</p>

    		<h2 id="characteristics"><a href="#characteristics">Characteristic script features</a></h2>
			<div class="section2"> 

				<h3 id="directionposn"><a href="#directionposn">Direction and positioning of script</a></h3>
				<p>All Indic scripts run left to right, although some combining glyphs appear to the left of their base character for display (see the
					discussion of vowel signs below). </p>
				<p>In a number of scripts, characters commonly have a headstroke and a high baseline. Such characters typically hang from the line when
					written.</p>
		  </div>
			<div class="section2"> 

				<h3 id="consonantvowel"><a href="#consonantvowel">Consonants and inherent vowels</a></h3>
				<p>These scripts are often called <em>abugidas</em> or <em>alpha-syllabaries</em>.</p>
				<p>In this type of script, consonant characters represent a consonant+vowel syllable. The consonant is associated with an <em>inherent
					vowel</em> that has to be overridden if it is not the required vowel sound for a particular spoken syllable. For example,
					the character <img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" /> in Hindi (Devanagari script) is pronounced <span class="ipa">kə</span> rather than
				  just <span class="ipa">k</span>. The <span class="ipa">ə</span> sound is the inherent vowel, and is usually transcribed as 'a'.</p>
				<p>Note that the inherent vowel is not always pronounced. For example in Hindi it is not usually pronounced at the end of a word,
					although a ghost echo may appear after a word-final cluster of consonants, eg. <img src="images/jogj.png" class="ex" alt="योग्य" /> <span
					class="ipa">jogj<sup>ə</sup></span>, or <img src="images/rastr.png" class="ex" alt="राष्ट्र" />  <span class="ipa">ɾəstɾ<sup>ə</sup></span>. In
					addition Hindi has a general rule that when a word has three or more syllables and ends in a vowel other than the inherent a, the penultimate vowel
					is not pronounced, eg. <img src="images/samajh.png" class="ex" alt="समझ" /> <span class="ipa">səməɟʰ</span> but
					<img src="images/samjha.png" class="ex" alt="समझा" /> <span class="ipa">səmɟʰaː</span>, <img src="images/rehen.png" class="ex" alt="रहन" /> <span
					class="ipa">rəhən</span> but <img src="images/rehna.png" class="ex" alt="रहना" /> <span class="ipa">rəhnaː</span>. (For a number of reasons,
					however, this rule does not always hold.)</p>
				<p>Nonetheless, on the whole, Indic scripts are close to phonemic transcriptions. The pronunciation of consonants is typically quite
        regular and predictable, although there is the occasional exception. The following are two examples of exceptions:</p>
				<div class="block-indent"> 
					<p>Example 1: voiced aspirated plosives and the non-initial letter HA in Gurmukhi are used to indicate tones rather than sounds. For
						example a voiced, aspirated plosive in word-initial position represents an <em>unvoiced unaspirated</em> plosive sound with a low tone on the
						syllable, eg. <img lang="pa" src="images/kora.png" class="ex" alt="ਘੋੜਾ" /> <span class="ipa">kòɽɑ</span> (The primary use of all voiced aspirated plosives in Gurmukhi is to
						express tone information.)</p>
					<p>Example 2: in Tamil, consonants such as <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-ka.png" class="ex" alt="க" /> are typically phonemic rather than phonetic. In practise, this
						consonant may represent any of <span class="ipa">kʌ, gʌ, xʌ, ɣʌ, hʌ</span>.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Most scripts supplement a basic set of letters with additional letters used to represent the sounds of other languages, such as
					Sanskrit and English. These additional letters are commonly formed by adding a diacritic to an existing letter. This diacritic is called a
					<em>nukta</em> in the Unicode Standard, although the name used by speakers of different Indian languages may vary. Some scripts use this diacritic
					with several basic letters (eg. Devanagari), others not at all (eg. Kannada).</p>
				<p>Examples:</p>
				<blockquote class="block-indent"> 
					<p>Devanagari, <img src="images/qa.png" class="ex" alt="क़" /> <span class="ipa">qə</span> (cf.
						<img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" /> <span class="ipa">kə</span>)</p>
			    <p>Gurmukhi, <img lang="pa" src="images/lle.png" class="ex" alt="ਲ਼" /> <span class="ipa">ɭə</span> (cf. <img lang="pa" src="images/le.png" class="ex" alt="ਲ" /> <span class="ipa">lə</span>)</p>
					<p>Oriya, <img lang="or" src="images/or-rra.png" class="ex" alt="ଢ଼" /> <span class="ipa">ɽʰ</span> (cf. <img lang="or" src="images/or-dda.png" class="ex" alt="ଢ" /> <span class="ipa">ɖʰ</span>)</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>It is possible to 'kill' the inherent vowel sound where it would normally be pronounced. This is achieved by attaching a small
					diacritic mark, called a <em>virama</em> in the Unicode Standard, to the consonant in question.</p>
				<p>Examples:</p>
				<blockquote class="block-indent"> 
					<p>Gujarati, <img lang="gu" src="images/gu-k.png" class="ex" alt="ક્" /> <span class="ipa">k</span> (cf. <img lang="gu" src="images/gu-ka.png" class="ex" alt="ક" /> <span class="ipa">kə</span>)</p>
					<p>Tamil, <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-k.png" class="ex" alt="க்" /> <span class="ipa">k</span> (cf. <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-ka.png" class="ex" alt="க" /> <span class="ipa">kʌ</span>)</p>
					<p>Telugu, <img lang="te" src="images/te-k.png" class="ex" alt="క్" /> <span class="ipa">k</span> (cf. <img lang="te" src="images/te-ka.png" class="ex" alt="క" /> <span class="ipa">kʌ</span>)</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>In the examples that follow, single consonants pronounced without the inherent vowel are depicted with a virama.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section2"> 

				<h3 id="vowelsigns"><a href="#vowelsigns">Vowel signs</a></h3>
				<p>Where a consonant is followed by a vowel other than the inherent vowel, the change is produced by adding a <em>vowel sign</em>  (called a <em>matra</em> in Sanskrit) to the
					base consonant. A consonant can only support one vowel (and one vowel sign) at a time. A vowel
				  sign may appear to the left or right, above or below the base consonant, and sometimes surrounds the base consonant on more than one side.</p>
				<p>The following illustrates the use of vowel signs with the <img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" /> consonant in Hindi, and
				  the resultant sounds:</p>
				<blockquote class="block-indent"> 
				  <p><img src="images/kii.png" class="ex" alt="की" /> <span class="ipa">kiː</span> &nbsp; <img src="images/ke.png" class="ex" alt="के" /> <span class="ipa">ke</span> &nbsp; <img src="images/kuu.png" class="ex" alt="कू" /> <span class="ipa">kuː</span></p>
	      </blockquote>
				<p>Vowel signs may also appear to the left of the base consonant they are related to. For example:</p>
				<blockquote class="block-indent"> 
					<p>Gujarati, <img lang="gu" src="images/gu-ka.png" class="ex" alt="ક" /> + <img lang="gu" src="images/gu-vsii.png" class="ex" alt="િ" /> -&gt; <img lang="gu" src="images/gu-ki.png" class="ex" alt="કિ" /> <span class="ipa">ki</span></p>
					<p>Tamil, <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-ka.png" class="ex" alt="க" /> + <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-vsai.png" class="ex" alt="ை" /> -&gt; <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-kai.png" class="ex" alt="கை" /> <span class="ipa">kʌy</span>)</p>
<!--<p>Oriya, <span class="or ex">କ</span> + <span class="or ex">େ</span> -&gt; <span class="or ex">କେ</span> /<span class="ipa">k</span>/</p>--></blockquote>
				<p>Occasionally a vowel sign may be composed of multiple parts. In some cases such a split vowel sign may have parts on both the left and
					right of the base character simultaneously, eg. in Tamil <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-ka.png" class="ex" alt="க" /> + <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-vso.png" class="ex" alt="ொ" /> -&gt; <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-ko.png" class="ex" alt="கொ" />
					<span class="ipa">ko</span>. In Kannada there are no vowel signs that surround a base character on both left and right, but there are some that
					have multiple parts above and following the base character, eg. <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-ka.png" class="ex" alt="ಕ" /> + <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-vs-oo.png" class="ex" alt="ೋ" /> -&gt; <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-koo.png" class="ex" alt="ಕೋ" /> <span class="ipa">koː</span>. Another alternative is top and bottom, eg. Telugu <img lang="te" src="images/te-ka.png" class="ex" alt="క" /> + <img lang="te" src="images/te-vs-ai.png" class="ex" alt="ై" /> -&gt; <img lang="te" src="images/te-kai.png" class="ex" alt="కై" /> <span class="ipa">kaj</span>. In some cases, the additional parts can be viewed as
					lengthening marks.</p>
				<p>Often the pairing of base character and vowel sign produces a change in the basic shape of either base character or vowel sign or
					both. Tamil provides many such examples, especially with <span class="ipa">u</span> and <span class="ipa">uː</span>. For example, the following
		      are a selection of the Tamil consonants, each followed by the same vowel sign, <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-vsu.png" class="ex" alt="ு" /> <span class="ipa">u</span>:</p>

				<p>Note that there is no vowel sign for the sound associated with the inherent vowel A. Vowel signs are only needed to <em>change</em>
					the inherent vowel.</p>
				<p>Because a consonant (or consonant cluster) can only support one vowel at a time, note the difference in Devanagari between

					independent vowel. In the second case only, the independent vowel sound is retained immediately after the initial <span class="ipa">k</span>, and

				<p>Gurmukhi is unusual in that, with the exception of <img lang="pa" src="images/pa-a.png" class="ex" alt="ਅ" /> <span class="ipa">ə</span>, there are no independent

				<h3 id="consonantclusters"><a href="#consonantclusters">Consonant clusters</a></h3>
				<p>Where consonants appear together without intervening vowels special steps need to be taken to indicate that the inherent vowels have
					disappeared. There are many ways in which this is achieved in Indic scripts, and the specifics of how each character behaves are too many to
					catalogue here in detail for each script. There are, however, two main approaches: either (a) change the shape of the consonants or merge them
					together in some way (a <em>conjunct</em> form), or (b) use a special diacritic to indicate the absence of intervening vowels.</p>
			  <p>A number of strategies are used to show consonant clusters by merging or changing shapes, and nearly all scripts employ more than one
				  of these approaches. The following are a few examples:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> 
						<p>For 60% of Devanagari conjuncts the consonants that lose the vowel typically lose their characteristic vertical bar (which is
							historically associated with the sound of the inherent vowel). Such glyphs are referred to as <em>half-forms</em>. For example,
							<img src="images/s.png" class="ex" alt="स्" /> <span class="ipa">s</span> + <img src="images/ma.png" class="ex" alt="म" /> <span
							class="ipa">mə</span> -&gt; <img src="images/sma.png" class="ex" alt="स्म" /> <span class="ipa">smə</span>.</p>
					</li>
					<li> 
						<p>Sometimes the two consonant glyphs may be combined vertically. For example, certain combinations in Gujarati  such as							<img src="images/gu-tt.png" class="ex" alt="ટ્" /> <span class="ipa">ʈ</span> +  <img src="images/gu-ttha.png" class="ex" alt="ઠ" /> <span class="ipa">ʈʰə</span> -&gt; <img src="images/gu-ttttha.png" class="ex" alt="ટ્ઠ" /> <span class="ipa">ʈʈʰə</span>. Note that the choice of vertical vs. horizontal combination may be a stylistic preference. For example, the result
							of <img src="images/kvirama.png" class="ex" alt="क्" /> <span class="ipa">k</span> + <img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" /> <span
							class="ipa">kə</span> in Devanagari could be rendered as either a vertical <img src="images/kkligature.png" class="ex" alt="क्क" /> or horizontal <img src="images/khalfk.png" class="ex" alt="क्क" /> combination.</p>
					</li>
					<li>					  Clustering may produce a conjunct that does not have easily recognisable parts, such as Bengali <img lang="be" src="images/be-ksha.png" class="ex" alt="ক্ষ" /><!--<img src="bengali-ksha.gif" height="12" width="17" alt="bengali conjunct for ksha" align="middle"/>-->
						<span class="ipa">kʃɔ</span> (= <img lang="be" src="images/be-k.png" class="ex" alt="ক্" /><!--<img src="bengali-k.gif" height="19" width="16" alt="bengali k" align="middle"/>-->
						<span class="ipa">k</span> + <img lang="be" src="images/be-ssa.png" class="ex" alt="ষ" /><!--<img src="bengali-sha.gif" height="15" width="13" alt="bengali sha" align="middle"/>-->
						<span class="ipa">ʃɔ</span>), or that expresses the conjunct by extension of a glyph such as the Malayalam <img lang="ma" src="images/ma-kka.png" class="ex" alt="ക്ക" /><!--<img src="malayalam-kka.gif" height="14" width="28" alt="malayalam kka" align="middle"/>-->
						<span class="ipa">kːa</span> (= <img lang="ma" src="images/ma-k.png" class="ex" alt="ക്" /><!--<img src="malayalam-k.gif" height="16" width="26" alt="malayalam k" align="middle"/>-->
						<span class="ipa">k</span> + <img lang="ma" src="images/ma-ka.png" class="ex" alt="ക" /><!--<img src="malayalam-ka.gif" height="16" width="22" align="middle" alt="malayalam ka"/>-->
					<span class="ipa">ka</span>).					</li>
					<li> 
						<p>Another common approach is to reduce and simplify one of the consonants in the cluster, and then attach it to the other like a
							diacritic. In Kannada most combinations are formed by reducing non-initial consonant glyphs in a cluster to a simplified form, joined beneath and/or
							to the right of the initial consonant, eg. <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-t.png" class="ex" alt="ತ್" /> + <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-ya.png" class="ex" alt="ಯ" /> -&gt; <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-kya.png" class="ex" alt="ತ್ಯ" /> <span
							class="ipa">tjʌ</span>. Oriya also often reduces the second consonant, but in some combinations will reduce the <em>first</em> consonant and attach
							it to the bottom of the second<!--, eg. <span style="font-family: code2000">କ୍</span> /<span class="ipa">k</span>/ + <span style="font-family: code2000">ତ</span> /<span class="ipa">tɔ</span>/ =&gt; <span style="font-family: code2000">କ୍ତ</span> /<span class="ipa">ktɔ</span>/-->.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Another approach is to simply show the virama we introduced earlier. This is really the standard approach for modern Tamil, eg.
					<img lang="ta" src="images/inta.png" class="ex" alt="இந்த" /> <span class="ipa">intʌ</span> (the dot is the virama), but may also be used for any other script if the font being
</p>
				<p>There is actually a third approach, and that is to simply rely on the user to recognise contexts where the inherent vowel is dropped.
					This occurs in some specific situations such as at the end of a word or those examples described earlier. The only script that does this as a
					<em>general rule</em> is Gurmukhi. Very few letter combinations are handled as conjuncts in Gurmukhi, most of the time the reader just has to know
					where the inherent vowel is not pronounced, eg. <img lang="pa" src="images/utsuk.png" class="ex" alt="ਉਤਸੁਕ" /> <span class="ipa">utsuk</span>.</p>
				<p>A common feature of Indic scripts is the gemination or lengthening of consonants. For example, note the lengthening of the
					<img src="images/la.png" class="ex" alt="ल" /> <span class="ipa">l</span> sound in <img src="images/chillahat.png" class="ex" alt="चिल्लहट" />
					<span class="ipa">cilːʌhʌʈ</span> (Devanagari). Such consonant lengthening is typically handled just as a normal consonant cluster. Gurmukhi,
					again, is somewhat non-standard in that it uses a special diacritic called <em>addak</em> in this situation. To indicate a geminated consonant, the
					addak sits above the <em>preceding</em> syllable, eg. <img lang="pa" src="images/putter.png" class="ex" alt="ਪੁੱਤਰ" /> <span class="ipa">putːər</span>.</p>
				<p>The letter RA is an example of a letter that typically behaves quite idiosyncratically in consonant clusters, and typically quite
					differently depending on whether it appears at the beginning or end of the cluster. Its placement also often involves apparent reordering. This can
					be illustrated with the Devanagari RA <img src="images/ra.png" class="ex" alt="र" />. When in initial position in the cluster the letter
					<img src="images/ra.png" class="ex" alt="र" /> is typically displayed as a small mark above the <em>right</em> shoulder of the last letter in the
					syllable, eg. <img src="images/sharma.png" class="ex" alt="शार्मा" /> <span class="ipa">ʃaːrmaː</span>. This is called a <em>repha</em>. A
					<img src="images/ra.png" class="ex" alt="र" /> in final position in a conjunct cluster is displayed as a small diagonal mark, but precisely where
					it appears depends on the shape of the previous consonant, eg. <img src="images/pra.png" class="ex" alt="प्र" /> <span class="ipa">pra</span>,
		        <img src="images/tra.png" class="ex" alt="त्र" /> <span class="ipa">tra</span>, <img src="images/hra.png" class="ex" alt="ह्र" /> <span
					class="ipa">hra</span>. With TTA and DDA it needs a little supporting line, eg <img src="images/ttra.png" class="ex" alt="ट्र" /> <span
					class="ipa">ʈra</span>, <img src="images/ddra.png" class="ex" alt="ड्र" /> <span class="ipa">ɖra</span>.</p>
<p>Note that a cluster is not limited to two consonants, eg. </p>
				<blockquote class="block-indent"> 
					<p><img src="images/r.png" class="ex" alt="र्" /> <span class="ipa">r</span> + <img src="images/g.png" class="ex" alt="ग्" /> <span class="ipa">g</span> + <img src="images/dha.png" class="ex" alt="घ" /> <span class="ipa">dʰʌ</span> -&gt;
						<img src="images/rgdh.png" class="ex" alt="र्ग्ध" /> <span class="ipa">rgdʰʌ</span></p>
        </blockquote>
				<p> This use of the repha, appearing as it does to the right of the whole cluster, demonstrates the syllabic nature of the Indic scripts.
					The following extension of the example shows even more clearly that the repha is actually positioned to the right of the <em>syllable</em>, rather
					than just the cluster, since it appears above the vowel sign.</p>
				<blockquote class="block-indent"> 
					<p><img src="images/r.png" class="ex" alt="र्" /> <span class="ipa">r</span> + <img src="images/g.png" class="ex" alt="ग्" /> <span class="ipa">g</span> + <img src="images/dha.png" class="ex" alt="घ" /> <span class="ipa">dʰʌ</span> +
						<img src="images/vsii.png" class="ex" alt="ी" /> <span class="ipa">iː</span> -&gt; <img src="images/rgdhii.png" class="ex" alt="र्ग्धी" /> <span
						class="ipa">rgdʰiː</span></p>
      </blockquote>
				<p>(Note that syllable boundaries in spoken text do not equate to those in written text. For example, 'Hindi' is spoken as 'hin-di', but
					written as 'hi-ndi'.)</p>

			<div class="section2"> 

				<h3 id="vsandcc"><a href="#vsandcc">Vowel signs used with consonant clusters</a></h3>
				<p>Where the vowel following a consonant cluster is rendered with a vowel sign, the placement of the vowel sign may need attention. As
					with the examples of the repha at the end of the last section, the syllabic nature of the script becomes apparent with the use of reordrant vowel
					signs attached to consonant clusters.</p>
				<p>In Devanagari, where a vowel sign that is is normally rendered to the left of a character is pronounced immediately after the cluster,
					it will be rendered to the left of the whole cluster, eg. in <img src="images/mushkil.png" class="ex" alt="मुश्किल" /> <span
					class="ipa">muʃkil</span>, the <img src="images/vsi.png" class="ex" alt="ि" /> is pronounced after the <img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" />.</p>
				<p>Vowel signs in a script like Kannada are visually attached to the first consonant in the cluster. Note how the vowel sign appears over
					the <span class="ipa">k</span> in <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-kri.png" class="ex" alt="ಕ್ರಿ" /> <span class="ipa">kri</span>, since the <span class="ipa">r</span> is rendered
					as a reduced appendage at the bottom right of the first consonant in the cluster.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section2"> 

				<h3 id="nasalisation"><a href="#nasalisation">Nasalisation and alternative nasal letter representations</a></h3>
				<p>There are three diacritics associated with the nasalisation of vowels or the alternative representation of nasal consonants as part of
					a consonant cluster. Which diacritic is used for which purpose varies from script to script. The following are a few examples of usage. (As usual,
					although these diacritics have their own names in the various languages represented by the scripts, I will refer to them using the generic names
					used in the Unicode Standard):</p>
				<ul>
					<li> 
						<p>In Devanagari, nasalisation of vowel sounds is indicated using the <em>candrabindu</em> <img src="images/candrabindu.png" class="ex" alt="ँ" /> or <em>anusvara</em> <img src="images/anusvara.png" class="ex" alt="ं" /> diacritics, eg.
							<img src="images/angrez.png" class="ex" alt="अँग्रेज़" /> <span class="ipa">ʌ̃grez</span>, <img src="images/nahin.png" class="ex" alt="नहीं" />
							<span class="ipa">nʌhĩː</span>. The anusvara is commonly used in conjunction with a vowel sign that extends above the headstroke.</p>
						<p>Nasal consonants in initial place in a conjunct may also be expressed using the anusvara over the previous letter, rather than
							as a half-glyph attached to the following consonant. The anusvara is written above the headstroke, at the right-hand end of the preceding character.
							In the list below both spellings are correct and equivalent, although the anusvara is preferred in the case of the first two:
							<img src="images/ranxg.png" class="ex" alt="रंग" /> = <img src="images/rang.png" class="ex" alt="रङ्ग" /> <span class="ipa">rʌŋg</span>,
							<img src="images/panxjabi.png" class="ex" alt="पंजाबी" /> = <img src="images/panjabi.png" class="ex" alt="पञ्जाबी" /> <span
							class="ipa">pʌɳɟaːbiː</span>, <img src="images/hinxdi.png" class="ex" alt="हिंदी" /> = <img src="images/hindi.png" class="ex" alt="हिन्दी" /> <span
							class="ipa">hindiː</span>, <img src="images/lamxba.png" class="ex" alt="लंबा" /> = <img src="images/lamba.png" class="ex" alt="लम्बा" /> <span class="ipa">lʌmbaː</span>. Note that the anusvara is still applied when the previous character has its own vowel
							sign. If the vowel sign is AA, the anusvara appears over the AA, eg. <img src="images/fraxsisi.png" class="ex" alt="फ़्रांसीसी" /> or
							<img src="images/axdolana.png" class="ex" alt="आंदोलन" />.</p>
					</li>
					<li> 
						<p>In Kannada the anusvara <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-anusvara.png" class="ex" alt="ಂ" /> is mostly used for nasal consonants that are homorganic with a following stop,
							eg. <img lang="ka" src="images/anga.png" class="ex" alt="ಅಂಗ" /> <span class="ipa">ʌŋga</span>. When followed by a consonant other than a stop or when word final, the anusvara is
							pronounced m, eg. <img lang="ka" src="images/simha.png" class="ex" alt="ಸಂಹ" /> <span class="ipa">simha</span>, <img lang="ka" src="images/lagaam.png" class="ex" alt="ಲಗಾಂ" /> <span class="ipa">lʌgaːm</span>.</p>
					</li>
					<li> 
						<p>In Oriya, homorganic nasal+stop clusters are usually written with distinctive conjunct letters<!--, eg. <span class="ka ex">ଅଙ୍କ</span> /<span class="ipa">ɔŋkɔ</span>/-->.
							However, the nasal may also be written with anusvara, eg. <img lang-"or" src="images/onko.png" class="ex" alt="ଅଂକ" /> <span class="ipa">ɔŋkɔ</span>.</p>
						<p>Nasalised vowels use the bindu, eg. <img lang-"or" src="images/or-ax.png" class="ex" alt="ଆଁ" /> <span class="ipa">ã</span>, <img lang-"or" src="images/or-kax.png" class="ex" alt="କାଁ" /> <span
							class="ipa">kã</span>.</p>
					</li>
					<li> 
						<p>Gurmukhi is unusual in that it has its own special diacritic for indicating nasalisation of vowel sounds. The tippi
							<img lang="pa" src="images/tippi.png" class="ex" alt="ੰ" /> is used over the preceding syllable with <span class="ipa">a</span>, <span class="ipa">ɪ</span>, <span
							class="ipa">ʊ</span> and final <span class="ipa">u</span>, eg. <img lang="pa" src="images/munda.png" class="ex" alt="ਮੁੰਡਾ" /> <span class="ipa">mʊɳɖɑ</span>.</p>
						<p>All other vowels use the anusvara <img lang="pa" src="images/pa-anusvara.png" class="ex" alt="ਂ" /> (called <em>bimdi</em> in Panjabi), eg. <img lang="pa" src="images/shaxt.png" class="ex" alt="ਸ਼ਾਂਤ" />
							<span class="ipa">ʃɑ̃t</span>.</p>

				<h3 id="visarga"><a href="#visarga">The visarga</a></h3>

				<p>In this section we need to make a clear distinction between <em>characters</em>, the basic codepoint units provided by the Unicode
					Standard for representation of the script in memory, and <em>glyphs</em>, the visual representation of one or more underlying characters when
					displayed or printed. As with other complex scripts, and unlike text in English, it is common to find situations where there is not a one-to-one
					mapping of characters to glyphs.</p>
				<p>I will try to use the terms character and glyph carefully in the following text to clarify whether we are talking about the
					representation of the text in memory or as rendered on-screen or in print.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section2"> 

				<h3 id="charsets"><a href="#charsets">Character sets</a></h3>
				<p>The characters in an Indic Unicode script block are a superset of the ISCII (Indian Standard Code for Information Interchange)
					character sets. The ISCII standard includes separate encodings for each of the scripts discussed here, using escape sequences to shift between them.
					The Unicode blocks were originally based on the 1988 version of ISCII encodings. ISCII published a new version of the standard in 1991 with a few
					changes to order and repertoire of characters. Unicode, nevertheless, remains a superset of all the ISCII codes, with the exception of a few Vedic
					extension characters.</p>
				<p>When first encoded in Unicode, the first 85 characters in each Unicode block were placed in the same order and position, on a script by script basis, as the 1988 ISCII
					characters for the respective script. Every script block orders analogous characters in the ISCII range in the same relative locations to the start
					of the block across all 9 scripts under consideration in this paper. The next 27 characters are additional Unicode characters, where each analogous
					character across the scripts is also assigned to the same code point relative to the beginning of the block. The final column is reserved for script
					specific characters. There is no special ordering here.</p>
				<p style="page-break-before: always;">In the following charts I will use colour coding to indicate the different ranges as follows:</p>
				<blockquote> 

					<table id="chart-key">

							<td class="td-iscii">ISCII-derived </td>

			 <!--<p>The zones described above are illustrated here using the Devanagari script block. The yellow background shows the ISCII-derived range,
				the orange is the coordinated Unicode extension range, and the brown is the range of additional script specific characters. (If viewing without
				colour, use the following grey shades: light shows the ISCII-derived range, medium is the coordinated Unicode extension range, and the dark is the
				range of additional script specific characters.)</p>-->

				<p>The fact that ISCII and Unicode attempt to use the same code point relative to the start of the code block for analogous characters
					across all nine Indic scripts theoretically allows for easy transliteration between the various scripts, however in practice there are quite a few
					exceptions in transliteration, so specific tables have to be developed anyway.<!-- For a more detailed discussion of this topic see the paper by Ram Viswanadha,

						<p>In older fonts the Tamil visarga, or aytham, was in some cases incorrectly rendered with a dotted circle before it in word-initial position (eg. in a word like <img lang="ta" src="images/ziroks.png" class="ex" alt="ஃஜிராக்ஸ்" />). This is because the Unicode Standard initially classified the Tamil visarga as a combining character.

						<p>The Kannada character U+0CDE KANNADA LETTER FA <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-fa.png" class="ex" alt="ೞ" /> was incorrectly named. A more appropriate name would be

				<h3 id="combiningchars" style="page-break-before: always;"><a href="#combiningchars">Combining characters</a></h3>
				<p>It is important to correctly order Indic characters in memory where combining characters are involved. The Unicode Standard requires
					that all combining characters be stored in memory after the base character they are combined with. This is a fundamentally important concept. It
					means that, even if a combining glyph appears to the left of its base character, it is stored <em>after</em> the base character in memory. (This is
					often referred to as <em>logical</em> ordering.)</p>
				<p>For example, the  characters in the word <img src="images/hinxdi.png" class="ex" alt="हिंदी" /> <span class="ipa">hindiː</span> are
					stored in memory as:</p>
				<blockquote class="block-indent"> 
				  <p><img src="images/hi-ha.png" class="ex" alt="ह" /> <span class="ipa">h</span> + <img src="images/hi-i.png" class="ex" alt="ि" />
						<span class="ipa">i</span> + <img src="images/anusvara.png" class="ex" alt="ं" /> <span class="ipa">n</span> +						<img src="images/hi-da.png" class="ex" alt="द" /> <span class="ipa">d</span> + <img src="images/hi-ii.png" class="ex" alt="ी" /> <span
						class="ipa">iː</span></p>
    </blockquote>
				<p>Lets see a slightly more complicated example from Kannada. The visual sequence <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-kri.png" class="ex" alt="ಕ್ರಿ" /> is pronounced <span class="ipa">kri</span>; the RA is rendered as a subscript to the bottom right and the vowel is rendered
					as a diacritic above the symbol for KA. The order of characters in memory (ignoring the virama, which is introduced in the next section) is:</p>
				<blockquote class="block-indent"> 
				  <p><img lang="ka" src="images/ka-ka.png" class="ex" alt="ಕ" /> <span class="ipa">k</span> + <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-ra.png" class="ex" alt="ರ" /> <span class="ipa">r</span> + <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-vs-i.png" class="ex" alt="ಿ" /> <span class="ipa">i</span></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>It is common that multiple combining characters are asssociated with a single base character. Examples of such combinations from
					Devanagari include an anusvara with a vowel sign, eg. <img src="images/hinxdi.png" class="ex" alt="हिंदी" /> <span class="ipa">hindiː</span>, or a
					visarga with a vowel sign, eg. <img src="images/duhk.png" class="ex" alt="दुःख" /> <span class="ipa">duhkʰ</span>. Where there are multiple
					combining characters, the Unicode Standard provides rules about relative ordering in memory that should be observed. If there is a nukta it must
					immediately follow the base character. Next comes any virama or any vowel sign, then any bindus. Observing these rules improves operability and
					simplifies operations such as searching, sorting, character indexing, and the like.</p>
				<p>The treatment of combining characters in Indic scripts also necessitates the use of context-based rules in the font to ensure the
					correct positioning and behaviour of displayed glyphs (a <em>glyph</em> being the visual representation of an underlying character). The position of
					a glyph for a combining character will commonly vary according to the shape and position of its base character, and any other combining characters
					associated with that base. In a number of cases, the combination of base character and combining character produces a fused shape that must be
			    rendered by use of a <em>ligature</em> glyph or other special context-sensitive glyph forms (see also the next section for use of the virama).</p>
				<p>Note also that reordering is not limited to displaying certain vowel signs to the left of the immediately preceding base consonant. In
					a consonant cluster a vowel sign that appears to the left may need to be displayed to the left of the whole consonant cluster, not just the preceding
					character. Similarly, the symbol for the consonant RA may be rendered as a diacritic at the far right of a syllable involving a consonant cluster
					that it logically begins.</p>
				<p>In addition, because the base character is typed first during normal keyboarding, the base character will typically need to be 'moved'
					slightly to the right to accommodate the combining character glyph that joins to the left. In practice, the entire word is redrawn with every Indic
					letter. This is typically done in an off-screen buffer and blitted to the screen. The effect is that characters appear to move and change shape
					considerably while one is typing.</p>
				<p>As mentioned earlier, a number of scripts (Bengali, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam) have vowel signs that are composed,
					visually, of more than one part. Such multi-part vowel signs can normally be represented using a single character. For example, Tamil
					<img lang="ta" src="images/ta-kau.png" class="ex" alt="கௌ" /> <span class="ipa">kʌʋ</span> can be represented using the characters <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-ka.png" class="ex" alt="க" /> and <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-au.png" class="ex" alt="ௌ" />. Kannada <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-koo.png" class="ex" alt="ಕೋ" /> <span class="ipa">koː</span> can be composed of the characters <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-ka.png" class="ex" alt="ಕ" /> and <img lang="ka" src="images/ka-vs-oo.png" class="ex" alt="ೋ" />. The Unicode charts typically do also provide separate characters that can be used to represent multi-part vowel signs.
					If these parts are not already available as simple vowel sign characters, they are provided as special 'length mark' characters  such as <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-lengthening.png" class="ex" alt="ௗ" /> and <img lang="ta" src="images/ka-lengthening.png" class="ex" alt="ೕ" />. Note also that if two characters are used to represent a split vowel sign both combining
					characters must <em>follow</em> the base character in memory (eg. <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-ka.png" class="ex" alt="க" /> + <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-e.png" class="ex" alt="ெ" /> + <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-lengthening.png" class="ex" alt="ௗ" />
					for the Tamil example <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-kau.png" class="ex" alt="கௌ" /> above).</p>
				<p>Although Unicode typically provides single characters for letters formed by the addition of a  nukta (eg.
					<img src="images/qa.png" class="ex" alt="&#x0958;" />, <img lang="pa" src="images/lle.png" class="ex" alt="&#x0A33;" />, and <img lang="or" src="images/or-rra.png" class="ex" alt="&#x0B5C;" />), these almost all have canonical
		      decompositions to base character plus nukta diacritic.</p>
				<p>Since there are alternative ways of representing multi-part vowel signs and consonants created using the nukta, the question arises,
					"Which approach should be used when entering Indic text?" The W3C recommends the use of NFC (Unicode Normalization Form C) for  web content. NFC
					represents all multi-part vowels as single characters, but all combinations of consonant plus nukta as two separate characters (apart from the 
					following exceptions in Devanagari: <img src="images/rra.png" class="ex" alt="ऱ" /> RRA, <img src="images/llla.png" class="ex" alt="ऴ" /> LLLA,
          and <img src="images/nnna.png" class="ex" alt="ऩ" /> NNNA).</p>
				<p>It was mentioned above that Gurmukhi is somewhat unusual in that vowel signs are carried by special 'vowel bearer' letters to create
					independent vowels. While Unicode does provide character codes for these vowel bearers, <img lang="pa" src="images/pa-ibase.png" class="ex" alt="ੲ" /> and <img lang="pa" src="images/pa-ubase.png" class="ex" alt="ੳ" />
					(plus, of course, <img lang="pa" src="images/pa-a.png" class="ex" alt="ਅ" />), their use isn't recommended. Instead Unicode provides precomposed characters for all the independent
		      vowel sounds needed, eg. <img lang="pa" src="images/pa-aa.png" class="ex" alt="ਆ" />, <img lang="pa" src="images/pa-i.png" class="ex" alt="ਇ" />, <img lang="pa" src="images/pa-u.png" class="ex" alt="ਉ" />, etc.</p>
				<p>Note however that, for the general case, whereas some other encoding systems for Indic represent an II SIGN, for example, by VIRAMA +
					VOWEL II, Unicode does not do that. It considers these two sequences to not be equivalent, and not have the same rendering.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section2"> 

				<h3 id="variantglyph"><a href="#variantglyph">Variant glyph forms</a></h3>
				<p>Unicode follows the rule of 'encode characters not glyphs'. This is a fundamentally important concept relating to the support of Indic
					scripts in Unicode. Even though there are many potential shapes for a character when displayed (half-form, conjunct, ligature, diacritic, etc.), the
					rule means that there is only one codepoint to represent that character. This is a major advantage for conducting operations on the text such as
					string comparison, collation, etc. It also allows for a much simpler keyboard, and simpler correspondence between the keyboard input and the stored
					text. The task of producing the right shape for printing or display of a character according to its context falls to the rendering algorithms of the
					font, application or system.</p>
				<p>We have already mentioned that combining character glyphs may sometimes adopt different shapes or merge with and alter the shape of
					the base consonant. Another key area where intelligent glyph shaping is required is the display of consonant clusters.</p>
				<p>Consonant clusters are invariably indicated in a sequence of Unicode characters by the presence of a VIRAMA character, whether or not
					the glyph for the virama will be visible on display. Thus the virama is the trigger for any complex glyph shaping that may be applied to a conjunct
					by the font or rendering algorithms.</p>
				<p>The outcome of a <em>consonant+virama+consonant</em> sequence will vary according to the characters, scripts, and fonts involved. Some
					possibilities are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> 
						<p>the initial consonant is rendered as a 'half-form' alternative glyph and no virama is shown, eg.
							<img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" /> + <img src="images/virama.png" class="ex" alt="्" /> + <img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" /> = <img src="images/khalfk.png" class="ex" alt="क्क" /></p>
					</li>
					<li> 
						<p>the two consonants and virama are represented by a single glyph (a ligature), eg. <img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" /> + <img src="images/virama.png" class="ex" alt="्" /> + <img src="images/ssa.png" class="ex" alt="ष" /> = <img src="images/kssa.png" class="ex" alt="क्ष" />
                         (or 
							<img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" /> + <img src="images/virama.png" class="ex" alt="्" /> + <img src="images/ka.png" class="ex" alt="क" /> = <img src="images/kkligature.png" class="ex" alt="क्क" />  in some fonts)</p>
					</li>
					<li> 
						<p>one of the consonants is represented as a combining diacritic (that may or may not be spacing),  eg. <img src="images/ka-ta.png" class="ex" alt="ತ" /> +							<img src="images/ka-virama.png" class="ex" alt="್" /> + <img src="images/ka-ya2.png" class="ex" alt="ಯ" /> -&gt; <img src="images/ka-tya.png" class="ex" alt="ತ್ಯ" />.</p>
						<p>Note that in some cases the diacritic may appear in a very different position visually than
							the position of the character it represents in the text stream. For instance, we have already seen the example of the repha in
							<img src="images/rgdhii.png" class="ex" alt="र्ग्धी" /> <span class="ipa">rgdʰiː</span>. Even though the RA appears visually at the top right of the
							cluster, the sequence of characters underlying the cluster is:</p>
						<p><img src="images/ra.png" class="ex" alt="र" /> <span class="ipa">r</span> + <img src="images/virama.png" class="ex" alt="्" /> + <img src="images/ga.png" class="ex" alt="ग" /> <span class="ipa">g</span> + <img src="images/virama.png" class="ex" alt="्" /> + <img src="images/dha.png" class="ex" alt="ध" /> <span class="ipa">dʰʌ</span> + <img src="images/vsii.png" class="ex" alt="ी" /> <span class="ipa">iː</span></p>
					</li>
					<li> 
						<p>the virama may simply be displayed as a combining glyph. In some scripts (eg. Tamil) this is very much the norm, eg.
							<img lang="ta" src="images/ta-na.png" class="ex" alt="ந" /> + <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-virama.png" class="ex" alt="்" /> + <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-ta.png" class="ex" alt="த" /> = <img lang="ta" src="images/ta-nta.png" class="ex" alt="ந்த" />. In other scripts (such as
							Devanagari) this is an optional scenario that depends on the preference of the user or the richness of the font - a font that has few ligatures and
							special glyph forms will resort to simply displaying the virama instead.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In Unicode it should be possible to force a consonant + virama sequence to display the virama (rather than convert the consonant to a
					half-form or ligature) by adding a ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER character (U+200C) immediately after the virama of the dead consonant. For example, this
    produces <img src="images/kviramak.png" class="ex" alt="क्‌क" /> rather than <img src="images/kk.png" class="ex" alt="क्क" />.</p>
				<p>To force a dead consonant to assume a half-form rather than combine as part of a ligature, place a ZERO WIDTH JOINER character
					(U+200D) immediately after the virama. For example, this produces <img src="images/kzwjssa.png" class="ex" alt="क्‍ष" /> rather than
					<img src="images/kssa.png" class="ex" alt="क्ष" />. The zero width joiner can also be used to produce an example of a half-form on its own for
					illustration purposes, eg. <img src="images/kviram.png" class="ex" alt="क्‍" />. You can also create half-forms of combining ligatures, eg.
					<img src="images/ttviram.png" class="ex" alt="त्त्‍" />.</p>

				<h3 id="otherpractical"><a href="#otherpractical">Other practical considerations</a></h3>
				<p> Where scripts use glyphs that hang from the baseline, rather than sitting on the baseline, it is important to ensure that any glyphs
					from another intermixed script (eg. Latin script letters) are correctly aligned with the Indic script. It is also important to ensure that the glyphs
					are aligned as expected with other elements, such as table cells, graphic elements, and the like. For a detailed treatment of the issues for
					alignment of such scripts with other fonts see Steve Zilles' talk, 'Internationalized Text Formatting in CSS and XML' in the proceedings of
					IUC22.</p>
				<p>There are other practical considerations related to enabling Indic script input and display. Keyboards must, of course, provide access
					to all needed characters, but consider standardisation of layout. On-screen display must support adequate resolution and line height, as well as
					proportional spacing.</p>

				<dt>bindu</dt>
				<dd>A diacritic used to represent nasalisation of vowels and/or to represent nasalised consonants. See Nasalisation and alternative nasal
					letter representations.</dd>
				<dt>combining character</dt>
				<dd>A character that graphically combines with a preceding base character. Combining characters are not usually used on their own, They
					include combining accents, diacritics, vowel signs, etc.</dd>
				<dt>conjunct forms</dt>
				<dd>A special graphical representation used to display a combination of consonants without intervening vowels. See Consonant
					clusters.</dd>
				<dt>diphthong</dt>
				<dd>A pair of vowels considered to be a single phoneme where the tongue moves from one to the other in such as way as to cause continual
					change in vowel quality.</dd>
				<dt>glyph</dt>
				<dd>The visual representation of one or more underlying characters. A font is made up of a set of glyph images.</dd>
				<dt>half-form</dt>
				<dd>A reduced version of a consonant glyph (typically missing the vertical stem) used to represent a consonant without a following vowel.
					See Consonant clusters.</dd>
				<dt>homorganic</dt>
				<dd>A consonant articulated at the same point in the vocal tract as a consonant in another class. For example, ŋ is the homorganic
					nasal of k.</dd>
				<dt>independent vowel</dt>
				<dd>A vowel used at the beginning of a word or within a word immediately after another vowel sound. See Independent vowels.</dd>
				<dt>inherent vowel</dt>
				<dd>In Indic scripts a consonant character represents a syllable that includes the consonant followed by a default (inherent) vowel
					sound. This vowel sound varies by language and script. See Consonants and inherent vowels.</dd>
				<dt>ligature</dt>
				<dd>A glyph representing a combination of two or more characters.</dd>
				<dt>logical order</dt>
				<dd>The order in which text is usually typed on a keyboard. For the most part, logical order corresponds to phonetic order.</dd>

					vowels.</dd>
				<dt>plosive</dt>
				<dd>A sound produced by the mouth in such as way as to temporarily block the passage of the air, eg. a p.</dd>
				<dt>phoneme</dt>

				<dt>tippi</dt>
				<dd>A diacritic used in Gurmukhi to represent nasalisation of vowels and/or to represent nasalised consonants in the following syllable.
					See Nasalisation and alternative nasal letter representations.</dd>
				<dt>virama</dt>
				<dd>A combining mark used to indicate a consonant without a following vowel. See Consonants and inherent vowels.</dd>
				<dt>visarga</dt>
				<dd>A character used most commonly to transcribe Sanskrit, but also sometimes having additional uses such as in Tamil where it is used in
					conjunction with other characters to create sounds not in the basic repertoire. See Visarga.</dd>
				<dt>vowel sign</dt>
				<dd>A combining character used to indicate the replacement of the inherent vowel associated with a consonant with another vowel sound.
