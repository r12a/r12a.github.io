    <p>Vertical Mongolian lines are stacked from the left to the right of the page, but this is very unusual. Mongolian is also unusual in that it is only meant to be read vertically.</p>
    <p>Lines in vertical Chinese, Japanese and Korean are stacked from the right to the left of the page. All of these scripts can also be set
      horizontally.</p>
    <p>In Japan, vertically oriented text is still very common in printed matter such as books, magazines and newspapers. It is also quite common for Traditional Chinese. It is less common, but still found for Simplified Chinese and Korean text.</p>

  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>Text in right-to-left scripts does not always flow right to left. Embedded Latin text and all numbers are read left to right. It is for
      this reason that these scripts are referred to as <span class="newterm">bidirectional</span>.</p>
    <p>The slide illustrates the direction of the eye while reading the line containing a date.</p>
    <p>Note that there may be slight differences between the Arabic and Hebrew approaches here. The Arabic for the dates ’10-12’ reads ’12-10’ – only the numbers flow left to right. In Hebrew it is likely that you would see ’10-12’ – the whole expression now runs left to right.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/bidi3.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>It is important to understand that the order of characters in memory is unidirectional, following what is called the <span
			 class="newterm">logical order</span>. The reordering you see on screen or paper is magic worked by the text rendering algorithms of the software.</p>
    <p>The order in memory essentially follows the order in which the text is typed. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/bidi4.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>East Asian scripts often used to also be read from right to left, though this is much less common nowadays. The example shown on the slide
      is a Traditional Chinese newspaper where the text of the articles is predominantly vertical. The headings of the articles and the captions of the
      pictures run right to left. In this way the reading direction of the horizontal text is consistent with the flow of text in the surrounding
      articles.</p>
    <p>Japanese text never does this any more. Even in newspapers containing vertically set text, the titles and captions always run left to
      right these days. </p>

    <h3><a href="algorithm">Unicode bidirectional algorithm</a></h3>
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/algorithm.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>The Unicode Standard has a <span class="newterm">Bidirectional Algorithm</span> that should be used to support the display of bidi text. Unlike many character sets,
      Unicode provides several properties of semantic information for every character. One of these properties indicates the behavior of the character with
      regard to inline directionality.</p>
    <p>All Arabic and Hebrew letters have a directional type of right-to-left. Most other letters have a left-to-right type, including all
      numbers. Punctuation is typically directionally neutral, since its location depends on the context.</p>
    <p>The next slide illustrates the use of this typing. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/algorithm2.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>As each of the right-to-left typed characters are typed on the first and second lines the bidirectional algorithm will place the next
      character to the left of the previous one.</p>
    <p>Because the numbers have a type of left-to-right, the 0 is automatically added to the right of the 1.</p>
    <p>The punctuation relies on context to determine its position, so when it is initially entered the rendering algorithm assumes that it is a
      sentence-final period and part of the overall right-to-left flow. If a space and some more Hebrew characters was then input the period would remain
      there.</p>
    <p>If, however, the next input character is a number, the rendering algorithm views the period as part of the left-to-right flow of the
      number, and moves it automatically to the right of the 10.</p>
    <p>The bidirectional algorithm is somewhat more complicated than this in reality, but this helps you understand the basic idea. </p>

<div id="mirrored" class="slide">
    <h3><a href="mirrored">Mirrored characters</a></h3>
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/mirrored.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>The treatment of paired characters such as parentheses deserves a brief mention here. The text on the slide flows consistently from right
      to left. The point of interest is the shape of the parentheses.</p>
    <p>The first parenthesis encountered while reading – looks like ')' – is actually a LEFT PARENTHESIS, ie. in left-to-right text it looks like
      '('. The bidirectional algorithm expects the visual shape of such <span class="newterm">mirrored characters</span> to be swapped when used in a right-to-left context. (In Unicode
      1.0 the LEFT PARENTHESIS was actually referred to as OPENING PARENTHESIS.)</p>
    <p>This approach facilitates the matching of character sequences across scripts. </p>
    <p class="slide-bottom">&nbsp;<a href="#topbar">go to top of page</a></p>
  </div>
</div>
<div id="controls" class="slide">
    <h3><a href="controls">Bidi formatting control characters</a></h3>
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/controls.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/controls2.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>There are occasionally situations where the bidirectional algorithm needs a little help to determine the directional context.</p>
    <p>Unicode provides special, invisible control codes to help clarify such ambiguities or intentional deviations from the rules of the
      bidirectional algorithm.</p>
    <p>The sample sentence preceded by the asterisk on the slide shows what you get if you rely solely on the bidirectional algorithm, due to the
      inherent ambiguity of the phrase.</p>
    <p>By applying an embedding control character as shown in the view of the logical order of characters at the bottom of the slide, the correct
      result can be obtained (the middle line).</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although these codes should do the job, in marked up text such as HTML and XML you should not use these control
      codes but use available markup instead (eg. the dir attribute in HTML). </p>

<div id="selection" class="slide">
    <h3><a href="selection">Visual selection</a></h3>
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/selecting.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>The difference between the logical, underlying order of bidirectional text and the displayed order of characters also has an impact on
      highlighting.</p>
    <p>The next slide illustrates what may happen if you place your cursor at the point labeled “Start here” and extend your selection to the
      point marked “End here”. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/selecting2.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>As you can see here, two separate ranges of text have been highlighted, one of which falls outside the two points we mentioned on the
      previous slide. A look at the underlying codes (see the bottom of the slide) immediately reveals the inherent logic in this approach. Although this
      operation produced two visual selections, it produced only a single logical selection in memory.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to find applications that would have produced a single visual highlight in this case. It is important to note,
      however, that this would represent two independent logical selections in memory. </p>

  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>In addition to layout of user interfaces, directionality may affect the layout of charts, tables, spreadsheets, collated pictures, and the
      like. (This appears to more consistently the case for Arabic documents than for Hebrew.)</p>
    <p>(It is worth visiting the <a href="/scripts/summaries/arabic.html">Arabic</a> or <a href="/scripts/summaries/hebrew.html">Hebrew</a> sample page on the Web to see the effect of changing the directionality
      of the page on the table cells shown at the top of this slide. Just click on the button provided.)</p>
    <p>Also, any graphics showing directional bias will need to be mirrored. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/layout-graphics5.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>This slide shows a small selection of icons that exhibit directional bias and will probably need to be replaced with mirrored versions in
      an Arabic or Hebrew context.</p>
    <p>Because Arabic and Hebrew documents run right to left, the turnover should appear to the left. The icons in the middle include
      directionality that is based on the assumed direction of text flow. The top right icon shows cascading windows, but on many Arabic or Hebrew
      platforms the windows cascade to the left. And the bottom right icon portrays a table, which as we saw on the previous slide would most likely be
      mirrored.</p>
    <p>Note that the process of producing mirrored versions of these icons is fairly straightforward – just flip the graphic. This becomes more
      difficult if non-symmetrical letters have been used. (Although of course on another level, one could question the appropriateness of a Latin letter
      on an Arabic or Hebrew user interface.) In addition, the functionality associated with the undo and redo icons may require a relocation of icons,
      rather than a simple mirroring of the graphics. </p>
