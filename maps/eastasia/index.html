<section>
<p>This is a collection of maps set against the same, unchanging background, so that when you switch from map to map you can see how boundaries evolve. These maps are about East Asia, and the initial set are largely focused on China.</p>
<p>Click on the large links below to open an SVG map in a separate window. The commentary on this page provides information about the major historical changes, in chronological order, as you move from one map to another. I suggest that you open both windows side by side, if you are able.</p>
<p>Boundaries are <em>approximate</em> for a number of reasons: first, in the earlier times especially, the borders were only approximate anyway; second, I have usually deduced the boundary information from small-scale maps, and sometimes the lack of geographical features makes accuracy difficult; third, the sources often differ about where boundaries lay, or are tied to dates that are slightly different. <em>You should therefore treat the boundaries on the maps as approximate.</em> However, at this scale, and in order to provide an idea of key changes at the pan-Asian level, this is typically sufficient.</p>
<p>At the bottom right of each map you have options that bring things in and out of the map. These include: schematic vs. relief background; country and province borders vs. none, old vs. modern place names, old vs. modern city names, rivers vs none. Note, however, that the relief map comes with some borders and rivers already marked.</p>
<p>The background relief map is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:China_edcp_location_map.svg#/media/File:China_edcp_relief_location_map.jpg">Wikipedia</a>. The rest is hand-drawn.</p>

<p><span class="date">364</span> Julian's expedition against Persia. He is killed and his successor signs away the eastern half of Roman Mesopotamia and the overlordship of Ibera and Armenia.</p>
<p><span class="date">372</span> Eastward expansion of the Ostrogoths creates a reaction from the Huns, who destroy every force sent against them by Ermanarich, the Ostrogoth king. The Huns push forward to the Danube, crushing the Visigoths and enslaving the Gepids. Many Goths apply to the Roman Empire for sanctuary.</p>
<p><span class="date">376</span>  The Huns push forward to the Danube, crushing the Visigoths and enslaving the Gepids. Emperor Valens permits the Visigoths to cross the Danube into Roman territory to seek sanctuary. They are followed by Ostrogoths.</p>
<p><span class="date">378</span>The Visigoths revolt against the Romans sheltering them due to food shortages and abuse. While attacking them, the Roman Emperor is outflanked by Ostrogoths and killed with most of his staff. Rome begins recruiting more barbarians to bring their army up to date.</p>
<p><span class="date">387</span> Persia returns the Western fifth of Armenia for clear title to the remainder.</p>
<p><span class="date">395</span> The Visigoths revolt again under King Alaric and are offered land in Epirus. Meanwhile the Huns launch a concerted attack on the Roman Empire, attacking Thrace, Armenia and Cappadocia.</p>

<p><span class="date">402</span> Stilicho bundles the Visigoths back into Illyria.</p>

<p><span class="date">406</span> Entire tribes begin moving westwards, presumably to avoid harrassment by the Huns. In particular, this includes the Quadi and Marcomanni, known collectively as the Suevi, as well as the Asding and Siling Vandals and a clan of Alans from the Caucasus. On the last day of 406 the lead elements cross the Rhine into Gaul.</p>

<p><span class="date">411</span> The leader of the Roman garrison in Britain  is killed by Romans and Britain falls out of the Empire. </p>
<p>The Alans, Vandals and Suevi divide up Iberia between themselves. The Suevi and the Asding Vandals shared the northwestern province of Gallaecia, the Siling Vandals settle in Hispania Baetica, and the Alans in  Lusitania and Hispania Carthaginensis.</p>
<p><span class="date">412</span> Led by Athaulf, Alaric's successor, the Visigoths arrive in southern Gaul, but again need supplies. They agree to clear Spain of the Suevi and Vandals in return for lands in Gaul.</p>
<p><span class="date">416</span> The Visigoths rout the Siling Vandals and the Alans, but leave the Suevi and Asding Vandals in the north-west corner of the Iberian peninsula. The Alans seek shelter with the Asding Vandals.</p>
