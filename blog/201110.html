<p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="http://rishida.net/uniview/">&gt;&gt; Use UniView</a></p>
<p>This version updates the app per the changes during beta phase of the
 specification, so that it now reflects the finalised Unicode 7.0.0.</p>
<p>The initial in-app help information displayed for new users was 
significantly updated, and the help tab now links directly to the help 
page.</p>
<p>A more significant improvement was the addition of links to character
 descriptions (on the right) where such details exist. This finally 
reintegrates the information that was previously pulled in from a 
database. Links are only provided where additional data actually exists.
 To see an example, go <a href="http://rishida.net/uniview/?char=0624">here</a> and click on <span class="kw">See character notes</span> at the bottom right.</p>
<p>Rather than pull the data into the page, the link opens a new window 
containing the appropriate information. This has advantages for 
comparing data, but it was also the best solution I could find without 
using PHP (which is no longer available on the server I use). It also 
makes it easier to edit the character notes, so the amount of such 
detail should grow faster. In fact, some additional pages of notes were 
added along with this upgrade.</p>
<p>A pop-up window containing resource information used to appear when you used the query to show a block. This no longer happens.</p>
<h3>Changes in version 7beta</h3>
<p><em>I forgot to announce this version on my blog, so for good measure, here are the (pretty big) changes it introduced.</em></p>
<p>This version adds the 2,834 new characters  encoded in the Unicode 
7.0.0 beta, including characters for 23 new scripts. It also simplified 
the user interface, and eliminated most of the bugs introduced in the 
quick port to JavaScript that was the previous version.</p>
<p>Some features that were available in version 6.1.0a are still not available, but they are minor.</p>
<p>Significant changes to the UI include the removal of the ‘popout’ 
box, and the merging of the search input box with that of the other 
features listed under <span class="onscreen">Find</span>. </p>
<p>In addition, the buttons that used to appear when you select a 
Unicode block have changed. Now the block name appears near the top 
right of the page with a <img src="r12a_blog_files/info.gif" alt="I icon">
 icon. Clicking on the icon takes you to a page listing resources for 
that block, rather than listing the resources in the lower right part of
 UniView’s interface.</p>
<p>UniView no longer uses a database to display additional notes about 
characters. Instead, the information is being added to HTML files. </p>

<p>The editors of the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-text-3/#text-justify-property">CSS3 Text module</a>
 specification are currently trying to get more information about how to
 handle Korean justification, particularly when hanja (chinese 
ideographic characters) are mixed with Korean hangul.</p>
<p>Should the hanja be stretched with inter-character spacing at the 
same time as the Korean inter-word spaces are stretched?  What if only a
 single word fits on a line, should it be stretched using 
inter-character spacing?  Are there more sophisticated rules involving 
choices of justification location, as there are in Japanese where you 
adjust punctuation first and do inter-character spacing later?  What if 
the whole text is hanja, such as for an ancient document?</p>
<p>If you are able to provide information, take a look at what’s in the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-text-3/#text-justify-property">CSS3 Text module</a> and follow the thread on <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/2014JulSep/0002.html">public-i18n-cjk@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/">subscribe</a>).</p>

<p>About two weeks ago I attended the part of a 3-day Asia Pacific Top 
Level Domain Association (APTLD) meeting in Oman related to ‘Universal 
Acceptance’ of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), ie. domain names 
using non-ASCII characters.  This refers to the fact that, although IDNs
 work reasonably well in the browser context, they are problematic when 
people try to use them in the wider world for things such as email and 
social media ids, etc. The meeting was facilitated by Don Hollander, GM 
of APTLD.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of information from the presentations and discussions.</p>
<p>(By the way, Don Hollander and Dennis Tan Tanaka, Verisign, each gave
 talks about this during the MultilingualWeb workshop in Madrid the week
 before. You can find <a href="http://www.multilingualweb.eu/documents/2014-madrid-workshop/2014-madrid-program">links to their slides</a> from the event program.)</p>
<h3>Basic proposition</h3>
<p>International Domain Names (IDNs) provide much improved accessibility
 to the web for local communities using non-Latin scripts, and are 
expected to particularly smooth entry for the 3 billion people not yet 
web-enabled. For example, in advertising (such as on the side of a bus) 
they are easier and much faster to recognise and remember, they are also
 easier to note down and type into a browser.</p>
<p>The biggest collection of IDNs is under .com and .net, but there are 
new Brand TLDs emerging as well as IDN country codes.  On the Web there 
is a near-perfect correlation between use of IDNs and the language of a 
web site.</p>
<p>The problems tend to arise where IDNs are used across cultural/script
 boundaries.  These cross-cultural boundaries are encountered not just 
by users but by implementers/companies that create tools, such as email 
clients, that are deployed across multilingual regions.</p>
<p>It seems to be accepted that there is a case for IDNs, and that they 
already work pretty well in the context of the browser, but problems in 
widespread usage of internationalized domain names beyond the browser 
are delaying demand, and this apparently slow demand doesn’t convince 
implementers to make changes – it’s a chicken and egg situation.</p>
<p>The main question asked at the meeting was how to break the vicious 
cycle.  The general opinion seemed to lean to getting major players like
 Google, Microsoft and Apple to provide end-to-end support for IDNs 
throughout their produce range, to encourage adoption by others.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>Domain names are used beyond the browser context. Problem areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>email
<ul>
<li>email clients generally don’t support use of non-ascii email addresses</li>
<li>standards don’t address the username part of email addresses as well as domain</li>
<li>there’s an issue to do with smptutf8 not being visible in all the right places</li>
<li>you can’t be sure that your email will get through, it may be dropped on the floor even if only one cc is IDN</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>applications that accept email IDs or IDNs
<ul>
<li>even Russian PayPal IDs fail for the .рф domain</li>
<li>things to be considered include:
<ul>
<li>plain text detection: you currently need http or www at start in google docs to detect that something is a domain name</li>
<li>input validation: no central validation repository of TLDs</li>
<li>rendering: what if the user doesn’t have a font?</li>
<li>storage &amp; normalization: ids that exist as either IDN or punycode are not unique ids</li>
<li>security and spam controls: Google won’t launch a solution without 
resolving phishing issues; some spam filters or anti-virus scanners 
think IDNs are dangerous abnormalities</li>
<li>other integrations: add contact, create mail and send mail all show different views of IDN email address</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>search: how do you search for IDNs in contacts list?
<ul>
<li>search in general already works pretty well on Google</li>
<li>I wasn’t clear about how equivalent IDN and Latin domain names will be treated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mobile devices: surprisingly for the APTLD folks, it’s harder to 
find the needed fonts and input mechanisms to allow typing IDNs in 
mobile devices</li>
<li>consistent rendering:
<ul>
<li>some browsers display as punycode in some circumstances – not very user friendly</li>
<li>there are typically differences between full and hybrid (ie. partial) int. domain names</li>
<li>IDNs typed in twitter are sent as punycode (mouse over the link in the tweet on a twitter page)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Initiatives</h3>
<p>Google are working on enabling IDN’s throughout their application 
space, including Gmail but also many other applications – they pulled 
back from fixing many small, unconnected bugs to develop a company wide 
strategy and roll out fixes across all engineering teams.  The Microsoft
 speaker echoed the same concerns and approaches.</p>
<p>In my talk, I expressed the hope that Google and MS and others would 
collaborate to develop synergies and standards wherever feasible. 
Microsoft, also called for a standard approach rather than in-house, 
proprietary solutions, to ensure interoperability.</p>
<p>However, progress is slow because changes need to be made in so many places, not just the email client.</p>
<p>Google expects to have some support for international email addresses
 this summer. You won’t be able to sign up for Arabic/Chinese/etc email 
addresses yet, but you will be able to use Gmail to communicate with 
users on other providers who have internationalized addresses.  Full 
implementation will take a little longer because there’s no real way to 
test things without raising inappropriate user expectations if the 
system is live.</p>
<p>SaudiNIC has been running Arabic emails for some time, but it’s a 
home-grown and closed system – they created their own protocols, because
 there were no IETF protocols at the time – the addresses are actually 
converted to punycode for transmission, but displayed as Arabic to the 
user (<a href="http://nic.sa/">http://nic.sa</a>).</p>
<p>Google uses system information about language preferences of the user
 to determine whether or not to display the IDN rather than punycode in 
Chrome’s address bar, but this could cause problems for people using a 
shared computer, for example in an internet café, a conference laptop 
etc. They are still worrying about users’ reactions if they can’t 
read/display an email address in non-ASCII script. For email, currently 
they’re leaning towards just always showing the Unicode version, with 
the caveat that they will take a hard line on mixed script (other than 
something mixed with ASCII) where they may just reject the mail.</p>
<p>A trend to note is a growing number of redirects from IDN to ASCII, eg. <a href="http://%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE.%D1%80%D1%84/">http://правительство.рф</a> page shows <a href="http://government.ru/">http://government.ru</a> in the address bar when you reach the site.</p>
<h3>Other observations</h3>
<p>All the Arabic email addresses I saw were shown fully right to left, 
ie. &lt;tld&gt;&lt;domain&gt;@&lt;username&gt;. I wonder whether this 
may dislodge some of the hesitation in the IETF about the direction in 
which web addresses should be displayed – perhaps they should therefore 
also flow right-to-left?? (especially if people write domain names 
without http://, which these guys seem to think they will).</p>
<p>Many of the people in the room wanted to dispense with the http:// 
for display of web addresses, to eliminate the ASCII altogether, also 
get rid of www. – problem is, how to identify the string as a domain 
name – is the dot sufficient?? We saw some examples of this, but they 
had something like “see this link” alongside.</p>
<p>By the way, Google is exploring the idea of showing the user, by 
default, only the domain name of a URL in future versions of the Chrome 
browser address bar. A Google employee at the workshop said “I think 
URLs  are going away as far as something to be displayed to users – the 
only thing that matters is the domain name … users don’t understand the 
rest of the URL”. I personally don’t agree with this.</p>
<p>One participant proposed that government mandates could be very 
helpful in encouraging adaptation of technologies to support 
international domain names.</p>
<h3>My comments</h3>
<p>I gave a talk and was on a panel.  Basically my message was:</p>
<p>Most of the technical developments for IDN and IRIs were developed at
 the IETF and the Unicode Consortium, but with significant support by 
people involved in the W3C Internationalization Working Group. Although 
the W3C hasn’t been leading this work, it is interested in understanding
 the issues and providing support where appropriate.  We are, however, 
also interested in wider issues surrounding the full path name of the 
URL (not just the domain name), 3rd level domain labels, frag ids, IRI 
vs punycode for domain name escaping, etc.  We also view domain names as
 general resource identifiers (eg. for use in linked data), not just for
 a web presence and marketing.</p>
<p>I passed on a message that groups such as the Wikimedia folks I met 
with in Madrid the week before are developing a very wide range of fonts
 and input mechanisms that may help users input non-Latin IDs on 
terminals, mobile devices and such like, especially when travelling 
abroad. It’s something to look into. (For more information about 
Wikimedia’s jQuery extensions, see <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.webfonts">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.ime">here</a>.)</p>
<p>I mentioned the idea of bidi issues related to both the overall 
direction of Arabic/Hebrew/etc URLs/domain names, and the more difficult
 question about to handle mixed direction text that can make the logical
 http://www.oman/muscat render to the user as http://www.muscat/oman 
when ‘muscat’ and ‘oman’ are in Arabic, due to the default properties of
 the Unicode bidi algorithm. Community guidance would be a help in 
resolving this issue.</p>
<p>I said that the W3C is all about getting people together to find 
interoperable solutions via consensus, and that we could help with 
networking to bring the right people together.  I’m not proposing that 
we should take on ownership of the general problem of Universal 
Acceptance, but I did suggest that if they can develop specific 
objectives for a given aspect of the problem, and identify a natural 
community of stakeholders for that issue, then they could use our 
Community Groups to give some structure to and facilitate discussions.</p>
<p>I also suggested that we all engage in grass-roots lobbying, requesting that service/tool providers allow us to use IDNs.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>At the end of the first day, Don Hollander summed up what he had gathered from the presentations and discussions as follows:</p>
<p>People want IDNs to work, they are out there, and they are not going 
away.  Things don’t appear quite so dire as he had previously thought, 
given that browser support is generally good, closed email communities 
are developing, and search and indexing works reasonably well. Also 
Google and Microsoft are working on it, albeit perhaps slower than 
people would like (but that’s because of the complexity involved). There
 are, however, still issues.</p>
<p>The question is how to go forward from here. He asked whether APTLD 
should coordinate all communities at a high level with a global 
alliance.  After comments from panelists and participants, he concluded 
that APTLD should hold regular meetings to assess and monitor the 
situation, but should focus on advocacy.  The objective would be to 
raise visibility of the issues and solutions.  “The greatest 
contribution from Google and Microsoft may be to raise the awareness of 
their thousands of geeks.”  ICANN offered to play a facilitation role 
and to generate more publicity.</p>
<p>One participant warned that we need a platform for forward motion, 
rather than just endless talking. I also said that in my panel 
contributions. I was a little disappointed (though not particularly 
surprised) that APTLD didn’t try to grasp the nettle and set up 
subcommittees to bring players together to take practical steps to 
address interoperable solutions, but hopefully the advocacy will help 
move things forward and developments by companies such as Google and 
Microsoft will help start a ball rolling that will eventually break the 
deadlock. </p>

	<h2 class="post-title">Typography questions for HTML &amp; CSS:<br>Arabic justification</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Fri 23 May 2014 tagged as  <a href="blog/?tag=layout">layout</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=arabic">arabic</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>I’ve been trying to understand how web pages need to support 
justification of Arabic text, so that there are straight lines down both
 left and right margins.</p>
<p>The following is an extract from a talk I gave at the MultilingualWeb workshop in Madrid at the beginning of May.  (<a href="http://www.w3.org/International/talks/1405-madrid/slides.pdf">See the whole talk</a>.)  It’s very high level, and basically just draws out some of the uncertainties that seem to surround the topic.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that we want to justify the following Arabic text, so 
that there are straight lines at both left and right margins.</p>
<figure>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://rishida.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.08.10.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19_004.png" alt="Arabic justification #1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1061" srcset="http://rishida.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.08.10-300x184.png 300w, http://rishida.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.08.10.png 438w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" width="300" height="184"></a></p><figcaption>Unjustified Arabic text</figcaption></figure>
<p>Generally speaking, received wisdom says that Arabic does this by 
stretching the baseline inside words, rather than stretching the 
inter-word spacing (as would be the case in English text).</p>
<p>To keep it simple, lets just focus on the top two lines.</p>
<p>One way you may hear that this can be done is by using a special 
baseline extension character in Unicode, U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL. </p>
<figure>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://rishida.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.48.02.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19_008.png" alt="Arabic justification #2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1063" srcset="http://rishida.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.48.02-300x93.png 300w, http://rishida.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.48.02.png 439w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" width="300" height="93"></a></p><figcaption>Justification using tatweels</figcaption></figure>
<p>The picture above shows Arabic text from a newspaper where we have 
justified the first two lines using tatweels in exactly the same way it 
was done in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that this looks ugly, one of the big problems 
with this approach is that there are complex rules for the placement of 
baseline extensions.  These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>extensions can only appear between certain characters, and are forbidden around other characters</li>
<li>the number of allowable extensions per word and per line is usually kept to a minimum</li>
<li>words vary in appropriateness for extension, depending on word length</li>
<li>there are rules about where in the line extensions can appear – usually not at the beginning</li>
<li>different font styles have different rules</li>
</ul>
<p>An ordinary web author who is trying to add tatweels to manually justify the text may not know how to apply these rules.</p>
<p>A fundamental problem on the Web is that when text size or font is 
changed, or a window is stretched, etc, the tatweels will end up in the 
wrong place and cause problems. The tatweel approach is of no use for

 of a web page.</p>
<p>In the next picture we have simply switched to a font in the Naskh 
style. You can see that the tatweels applied to the word that was 
previously at the end of the first line now make the word to long to fit
 there. The word has wrapped to the beginning of the next line, and we 
have a large gap at the end of the first line.</p>

<p>To further compound the difficulties mentioned above regarding the 
rules of placement for extensions, each different style of Arabic font 
has different rules.  For example, the rules for where and how words are
 elongated are different in the Nastaliq version of the same text which 
you can see below. (All the characters are exactly the same, only the 
font has changed.) (See a description of <a href="http://www.cle.org.pk/Publication/papers/2004/rule-based-expert-system.pdf">how to justify Urdu text in the Nastaliq style</a>.)</p>

<p>And fonts in the Ruqah style never use elongation at all. (We’ll come
 back to how you justify text using Ruqah-style fonts in a moment.)</p>

<p>In the next picture we have removed all the tatweel characters, and 
we are showing the text using a Naskh-style font.  Note that this text 
has more ligatures on the first line, so it is able to fit in more of 
the text on that line than the first font we saw. We’ll again focus on 
the first two lines, and consider how to justify them.</p>

<p>High end systems have the ability to allow relevant characters to be

requiring additional baseline extension characters.  </p>

<p>In principle, if you are going to elongate words, this is a better solution for a dynamic environment.  It means, however, that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the rules for applying the right-sized elongations to the right 
characters has to be applied at runtime by the application and font 
working together, and as the user or author stretches the window, 
changes font size, adds text, etc, the location and size of elongations 
needs to be reconfigured</li>
<li>there needs to be some agreement about what those rules are, or at 
least a workable set of rules for an off-the-shelf, one-size-fits-all 
solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter  is the fundamental issue we face.  There is very little, 
high-quality information available about how to do this, and a lack of 
consensus about, not only what the rules are, but how justification 
should be done.</p>
<p>Some experts will tell you that text elongation is the primary method for justifying Arabic text (<a href="http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb27-2/tb87benatia.pdf">for example</a>),
 while others will tell you that inter-word and intra-word spacing 
(where there are gaps in the letter-joins within a single word) should 
be the primary approach, and kashida elongation may or may not be used 
in addition where the space method is strained.</p>
<figure>
<p style="line-height: 1; text-align:center;"><a href="http://rishida.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.55.08.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.png" alt="Arabic justification #8: space based" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1069" srcset="http://rishida.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.55.08-300x97.png 300w, http://rishida.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-23-at-19.55.08.png 441w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" width="300" height="97"></a></p><figcaption>Justification using inter-word spacing</figcaption></figure>
<p>The space-based approach, of course, makes a lot of sense if you are 
dealing with fonts of the Ruqah style, which do not accept elongation.  
However, the fact that the rules for justification need to change 
according to the font that is used presents a new challenge for a 
browser that wants to implement justification for Arabic.  How does the 
browser know the characteristics of the font being used and apply 
different rules as the font is changed?  Fonts don’t currently indicate 
this information.</p>
<p>Looking at magazines and books on a recent trip to Oman I found lots 
of justification.  Sometimes the justification was done using spaces, 
other times using elongations, and sometimes there was a mixture of 
both.  In a later post I’ll show some examples.</p>
<p>By the way, for all the complexity so far described this is all quite
 a simplistic overview of what’s involved in Arabic justification.  For 
example, high end systems that justify Arabic text also allow the 
typesetter to adjust the length of a line of text by manual adjustments 
that tweak such things as alternate letter shapes, various joining 
styles, different lengths of elongation, and discretionary ligation 
forms.</p>
<p>The key messages:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need an Arabic Layout Requirements document to capture the script needs.</li>
<li>Then we need to figure out how to adapt Open Web Platform technologies to implement the requirements.</li>
<li>To start all this, we need experts to provide information and develop consensus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any volunteers to create an Arabic Layout Requirements document?  The W3C would like to hear from you!</p>

<p>When it comes to wrapping text at the end of a line in a web page, 
there are some special rules that should be applied if you know the 
language of the text is either Chinese or Japanese (ie. if the markup 
contains a <code class="kw">lang</code> attribute to that effect). </p>
<p>The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-text-3/#line-break-property">CSS3 Text module</a> attempts to describe these rules, and we have some tests to check what browsers currently do for <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tests/repository/css3-text/line-break-jazh/results-ja">Japanese</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tests/repository/css3-text/line-break-jazh/results-zh">Chinese</a>.</p>
<p>There’s an open question in the editor’s draft about whether <strong>Korean</strong> has any special behaviours that need to be documented in the spec, when the markup uses <code class="kw">lang</code> to identify the content as Korean.</p>
<p>If you want to provide information, take a look at what’s in the CSS3
 Text module and write to www-international@w3.org and copy

	<p>If you put a <code class="kw">span</code> tag around one or two 
letters in an Arabic word, say to change the colour, it breaks the 
cursiveness in WebKit and Blink browsers. You can change things like 
colour in Mozilla and IE, but changing the font breaks the connection.  </p>
<p>Breaking on colour change makes it hard to represent educational 
texts and things such as the Omantel logo, which I saw all over Muscat 
recently. (Omantel is the largest internet provider in Oman.) Note how, 
despite the colour change, the Arabic letters in the logo below (on the

<p>Here’s <a href="http://www.dalilusa.com/arabic_course/lesson22.asp">an example of an educational page</a> that colours parts of words.  You currently have to use Firefox or IE to get the desired effect.</p>
<p>This lead to questions about what to do if you convert block elements, such as <code class="kw">li</code>, into inline elements that sit side by side. You probably don’t want the character at the end of one <code class="kw">li</code>
 tag to join with the next one. What if there is padding or margins 
between them, should this cause bidi isolation as well as preventing 
joining behaviour?</p>

<p>The webfonts make it possible to use the picker on an iPad or other

versa on my Snow Leopard Macbook.</p>
<p>I also added an HTML5 placeholder for the output box. (I’m wishing

<p>The main addition in this version is a couple of buttons that appear when you ask UniView to display a block.</p>
<p>Clicking on <span class="ui">Show annotated list</span> generates a list of all characters in the block, with annotations.</p>
<p>Clicking on <span class="ui">Show script links</span> displays a list
 of links to key sources of information about the script of the block, 
links to relevant articles and apps on the rishida.net site, and related
 fonts and input methods. This provides a very quick way of finding this
 information. One particularly useful link (‘Historical documentation’, 
which links to a Scriptsource.org page) allows you to find the proposals
 for all additions to Unicode related to the relevant script. These 
proposals are a mine of useful information about the individual 
characters in a block, and SIL staff should get a medal for trawling 
through all the relevant data to provide this.</p>
<p>In addition, there were some changes to the user interface, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of information in the lower right panel (detailed 
character information) was slightly changed, and two alterative 
representations of the character were added: an HTML escape, and a URI 
escape.</li>
<li>The search box at the top left was constrained to appear closer to the other controls when the window is stretched wide.</li>

<p>This HTML page allows you to expand information in the lines of the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt file</a>, edit them and generate a new version. It also checks the data for validity in a number of areas. </p>
<p>It can be helpful if you have the misfortune to pore over the source 
code of the UnicodeData.txt file and find your eyes blurring as you 
count fields. And it is particularly useful for people submitting 
proposals for new scripts or characters to the Unicode Consortium, to 
help them generate correct lists of unicode properties for inclusion in 
the proposal. (You can even build the whole thing in the UI, error free,
 by starting with a number of blank lines, such as <code>1111;NAME;;;;;;;;;;;;;</code>.)</p>
<p>The image below shows the page in action. I dropped in a couple of 
lines from the Ahom script proposal, and vandalised them slightly. The 
first panel shows that the app has spotted an error. I used the column 
to the right to edit out the error in the second panel, and regenerated 
the lines in the box below.</p>
<div class="center"><img class="withshadow" src="r12a_blog_files/unicodedata-small.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></div>
<p>Having made edits you can copy paste the output back into the top box
 to send it through the sausage machine again, and check that there are 
no remaining errors.</p>
<p>You can add a whole script block at a time to the top box, or a single line – as you like.</p>
<p>Well, it’s a bit esoteric, but hopefully it will be useful to someone somewhere.</p>

	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>This is a note to myself, so I remember what I did today.</p>
<p>I’d like to let people know when I have uploaded new photos to 
Flickr, but I’ve been relying so far on IFTTT, and the results haven’t 
been great. The notifications don’t actually point at the Flickr site, 
and notifications are fired off every time I upload something – which is
 too often.</p>
<p>It looks like I’ll need to manually fire off notifications, but I 
don’t want to have to do it separately for Twitter, Facebook and 
Google+. However I have set things up so that Google+ posts (public 
ones) go to Twitter, and Twitter posts go to Facebook.</p>
<p>Then the question was how to set up the Google+ post. Here’s the 
sequence of events, starting with the manual bit where I create a post 
in Google+:</p>
<p>[1] Add a blurb to the Google+ post, add a link using the link button
 to the set’s URI, and delete the description (leave the photo). (It 
didn’t work to link to a photo in lightview – you just get a link to the
 photo page.)</p>

<p>This produces a slightly different result on my iPad and HTC, with 
two photos shown and 3 more accessible via an expansion button.</p>
<p><img src="r12a_blog_files/flickr-google-mobile.png" alt="Picture of mobile google+ post."></p>
<p>[2] This produces an impressive tweet on a desktop machine, if you 
click on “Show photo”, that includes a link to a slide show. It also has
 links to many, but not all, of the photos individually. That was a bit 
of a surprise.</p>
<p><img src="r12a_blog_files/flickr-twitter.png" alt="Picure of twitter post."></p>
<p>On a mobile device, no photo is shown in the twitter stream. You just get the link (much like in [4] below).</p>
<p>[3] Not all of that gets forwarded to Facebook. Just the principal 
photo, and the blurb, but it also pulls the description back in from the
 flickr site.</p>

<p>I just uploaded an initial draft of an article <a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/balinese/">Balinese Script Notes</a>.
 It lists the Unicode characters used to represent Balinese text, and 
briefly describes their use. It starts with brief notes on general 
script features and discussions about which Unicode characters are most 
appropriate when there is a choice.</p>
<p>The script type is abugida – consonants carry an inherent vowel. It’s
 a complex script derived from Brahmi, and has lots of contextual 
shaping and positioning going on. Text runs left-to-right, and words are
 not separated by spaces.</p>
<p>I think it’s one of the most attractive scripts in Unicode, and for 
that reason I’ve been wanting to learn more about it for some time now.

<p class="floatright"><a href="http://rishida.net/blog/images/balinese-picker.png"><img class="withshadow" src="r12a_blog_files/balinese-picker-small.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></p>
<p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/pickers/balinese/" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Use it</a></p>
<p>This picker contains characters from the Unicode Balinese block 
needed for writing the Balinese language. Characters needed for Sasak 
are also available in the Advanced section. Balinese musical notation 
characters are not included.</p>
<p><strong>About the tool:</strong> Pickers allow you to quickly create 
phrases in a script by clicking on Unicode characters arranged in a way 
that aids their identification. Pickers are likely to be most useful if 
you don’t know a script well enough to use the native keyboard. The 
arrangement of characters also makes it much more usable than a regular 
character map utility.</p>
<p><strong>About this picker:</strong> Characters are grouped to aid 
input. The consonant block includes characters needed for Kawi and 
Sanskrit as well as the native Balinese characters, all arranged 
according to the Brahmi pronunciation grid.</p>
<p>The picker has only a default view and a font grid view. It’s 
difficult to put in the time for the shape-based, keyboard-based, and 
various transcription-based views in some other pickers. In a new 
departure, however, I have included a list of Latin characters on the 
default view to assist in writing transcriptions alongside Balinese 
text.</p>
<p>There is, however, a significant issue with this picker, due to the 
lack of support for Balinese as a script in computers. The only 
Unicode-based Balinese font I know of is Aksara Bali, but that font 
seems to only work as expected in Firefox on Mac OS X. Furthermore, the 
Aksara Bali font doesn’t handle ra repa as described in the Unicode 
Standard. The sequence &lt;consonant , adeg-adeg, ra repa&gt; produces a
 visible adeg-adeg, rather than the post-fixed form of ra repa. The 
sequence &lt;consonant , vowel sign ra repa&gt; produces the post-fixed 
form of ra repa, rather than the subjoined form. You can produce the 
post-fixed form with this font by using &lt;consonant , vowel sign ra 
repa&gt; and the subjoined form by using &lt;consonant , adeg-adeg, ra, 
pepet&gt;, but these sequences will produce content that cannot be 
matched against sequences using the Unicode approach, and content that 
may fail with other Unicode-compliant fonts in the future.</p>
<p>Hopefully some new, fully Unicode-compliant fonts will come along 
soon. This is one of the most beautiful scripts I have come across.</p>
<p>(Btw, I’m working on a set of notes for Balinese characters, linked 
from UniView, with some feature innovations to get around the font 
issue. Look out for that later. And I’m thinking I should develop a 
Javanese picker to go with this one. Just need a bit of time…)</p>
<p>For the curious, here’s the first article of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, as typed in the Balinese picker.

	<h2 class="post-title">HTML5 adds new translate attribute</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Wed 22 Feb 2012 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>A <code class="kw">translate</code> attribute was recently <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/global-attributes.html#the-translate-attribute">added to HTML5</a>. At the three <a href="http://multilingualweb.eu/">MultilingualWeb workshops</a>
 we have run over the past two years, the idea of this kind of 
‘translate flag’ has constantly excited strong interest from localizers,
 content creators, and from folks working with language technology.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Typically authors or automated script environments will put the 
attribute in the markup of a page. You may also find that, in industrial
 translation scenarios, localizers may add attributes during the 
translation preparation stage, as a way of avoiding the multiplicative 
effects of dealing with mistranslations in a large number of languages.</p>
<p>There is no effect on the rendered page (although you could, of 
course, style it if you found a good reason for doing so). The attribute
 will typically be used by workflow tools when the time comes to 
translate the text – be it by the careful craft of human translators, or
 by quick gist-translation APIs and services in the cloud.</p>
<p>The attribute can appear on any element, and it takes just two values: <code class="kw">yes</code> or <code class="kw">no</code>. If the value is <code class="kw">no</code>,
 translation tools should protect the text of the element from 
translation. The translation tool in question could be an automated 
translation engine, like those used in the online services offered by 
Google and Microsoft. Or it could be a human translator’s ‘workbench’ 
tool, which would prevent the translator inadvertently changing the 
text.</p>
<p>Setting this translate flag on an element applies the value to all 
contained elements and to all attribute values of those elements.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use <code>translate="yes"</code> for this to work. If a page has no <code class="kw">translate</code> attribute, a translation system or translator should assume that all the text is to be translated.  The <code class="kw">yes</code>
 value is likely to see little use, though it could be very useful if 
you need to override a translate flag on a parent element and indicate 
some bits of text that should be translated. You may want to translate 
the natural language text in examples of source code, for example, but 
leave the code untranslated.</p>
<h3>Why it is needed</h3>
<p>You come across a need for this quite frequently. There is an example
 in the HTML5 spec about the Bee Game.  Here is a similar, but real 
example from my days at Xerox, where the documentation being translated 
referred to a machine with text on the hardware that wasn’t translated.</p>
<blockquote translate="no"><p><code>&lt;p&gt;Click the Resume button on the Status Display or the<br>
&lt;span class="panelmsg" translate="no"&gt;CONTINUE&lt;/span&gt; button<br>
on the printer panel.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Here are a couple more (real) examples of content that could benefit from the <code class="kw">translate</code> attribute.  The first is from a book, quoting a title of a work.</p>
<blockquote translate="no"><p><code>&lt;p&gt;The question in the title 
&lt;cite translate="no"&gt;How Far Can You Go?&lt;/cite&gt; applies to 
both the undermining of traditional religious belief by radical theology
 and the undermining of literary convention by the device of "breaking 
frame"...&lt;/p&gt;</code></p></blockquote>
<p>The next example is from a page about French bread – the French for bread is ‘<span xml:lang="fr" translate="no" lang="fr">pain</span>‘.</p>
<blockquote translate="no"><p><code>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;strong 
translate="no"&gt;french pain&lt;/strong&gt; on Facebook. Join now to 
write reviews and connect with &lt;strong translate="no"&gt;french 
pain&lt;/strong&gt;. Help your friends discover great places to visit by
 recommending &lt;strong translate="no"&gt;french 
pain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p></blockquote>
<p>So adding the translate attribute to your page can help readers 
better understand your content when they run it through automatic 
translation systems, and can save a significant amount of cost and 
hassle for translation vendors with large throughput in many languages.</p>
<h3>What about Google Translate and Microsoft Translator?</h3>
<p>Both Google and Microsoft online translation services already 
provided the ability to prevent translation of content by adding markup 
to your content, although they did it in (multiple) different ways. 
Hopefully, the new attribute will help significantly by providing a 
standard approach.</p>
<p>Both Google and Microsoft currently support <code>class="notranslate"</code>,
 but replacing a class attribute value with an attribute that is a 
formal part of the language makes this feature much more reliable, 
especially in wider contexts. For example, a translation prep tool would
 be able to rely on the meaning of the HTML5 <code class="kw">translate</code>
 attribute always being what is expected. Also it becomes easier to port
 the concept to other scenarios, such as other translation APIs or 
localization standards such as XLIFF.</p>
<p>As it happens, the online service of Microsoft (who actually proposed
 a translate flag for HTML5 some time ago) already supported <code>translate="no"</code>.
 This, of course, was a proprietary tag until now, and Google didn’t 
support it. However, just yesterday morning I received word, by 
coincidence, that Webkit/Chromium has just added support for the <code class="kw">translate</code>  attribute, and yesterday afternoon Google added support for <code>translate="no"</code> to its online translation service. <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tests/html-css/translate/results-online">See the results</a> of some tests I put together this morning. (Neither yet supports the <code>translate="yes"</code> override.)</p>
<p>In these proprietary systems, however, there are a good number of 
other non-standard ways to express similar ideas, even just sticking 
with Google and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft apparently supports <code>style="notranslate"</code>.  This
 is not one of the options Google lists for their online service, but on
 the other hand they have things that are not available via Microsoft’s 
service.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an entire page that should not be translated, you can add <code>&lt;meta name="google" value="notranslate"&gt;</code> inside the <code class="kw">head</code> element of your page and Google won’t translate any of the content on that page. (However they also support <code>&lt;meta name="google" content="notranslate"&gt;</code>.)  This shouldn’t be Google specific, and a single way of doing this, ie. <code>translate="no"</code>  on the <code class="kw">html</code> tag, is far cleaner.</p>
<p>It’s also not made clear, by the way, when dealing with either 
translation service, how to make sub-elements translatable inside an 
element where <code class="kw">translate</code> has been set to <code class="kw">no</code> – which may sometimes be needed.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the new HTML5 translate attribute provides a 
simple and standard feature of HTML that can replace and simplify all 
these different approaches, and will help authors develop content that 
will work with other systems too.</p>
<h3>Can’t we just use the lang attribute?</h3>
<p>It was inevitable that someone would suggest this during the 
discussions around how to implement a translate flag, however 
overloading language tags is not the solution. For example, a language 
tag can indicate which text is to be spellchecked against a particular 
dictionary. This has nothing to do with whether that text is to be 
translated or not.  They are different concepts.  In a document that has
 <code>lang="en"</code> in the html header, if you set <code>lang="notranslate"</code>
 lower down the page, that text will now not be spellchecked, since the 
language is no longer English. (Nor for the matter will styling work, 
voice browsers pronounce correctly, etc.)</p>
<h3>Going beyond the translate attribute</h3>
<p>The W3C’s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its/">ITS (International Tag Set) Recommendation</a>
 proposes the use of a translate flag such as the attribute just added 
to HTML5, but also goes beyond that in describing a way to assign 
translate flag values to particular elements or combinations of markup 
throughout a document or set of documents. For example, you could say, 
if it makes sense for your content, that by default, all <code class="kw">p</code> elements with a particular class name should have the translate flag set to <code class="kw">no</code> for a specific set of documents.</p>
<p>Microsoft offers something along these lines already, although it is much less powerful than the ITS approach. If you use <code>&lt;meta name="microsoft" content="notranslateclasses myclass1 myclass2" /&gt;</code>
 anywhere on the page (or as part of a widget snippet) it ensures that 
any of the CSS classes listed following “notranslateclasses” should 
behave the same as the “notranslate” class.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Google’s translation engines also don’t translate content within <code class="kw">code</code>
 elements.  Note, however, that you don’t seem to have any choice about 
this – there don’t seem to be instructions about how to override this if
 you do want your <code class="kw">code</code> element content translated.</p>
<p>By the way, there are plans afoot to set up a new MultilingualWeb-LT 
Working Group at the W3C in conjunction with a European Commission 
project to further develop ideas around the ITS spec, and create 
reference implementations. They will be looking, amongst many other 
things, at ways  of integrating the new <code class="kw">translate</code> attribute into localization industry workflows and standards. Keep an eye out for it.</p>

			<p>Thanks Richard for posting this explanation. I think this is good news, and not just for online MT (as you note). So much content that goes through human workflows is in HTML (or XHTML) format, and so far what to translate has, for the most part, been left up to the translator’s discretion. While translators will generally get it right (which they can do because they are able to infer a lot about texts) they do sometimes get it wrong. Having this notion of a translate directive embedded at a fundamental level into core technologies is a major coup for the translation and localization industry because it will raise awareness and simplify processes.</p>
<p>I’m excited by the news that so many tools are already picking up on this new attribute. I’ve seen far too many instances where good ideas languish for years without adoption. I think this success vindicates the agile approach we anticipate for MultilingualWeb-LT of picking small, manageable problems and addressing them with simple solutions. While there is a place and need for mega-standards like XLIFF, TMX, TBX, etc., I think the future of standards will increasingly revolve around small standards that work together to create a whole greater than the sum of their parts. What’s fantastic about this approach is that developers will be able to implement the parts that matter to them without the overhead of implementing complex formats of limited value.</p>

	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Sun 12 Feb 2012 tagged as  <a href="blog/?tag=scripts">scripts</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=fonts">fonts</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>

<div class="post-content">
	<p class="floatright" style="width: 210px;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/fontlist.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></p>
<p>I’ve wanted to get around to this for years now. Here is a list of 
fonts that come with Windows7 and Mac OS X Snow Leopard/Lion, grouped by
 script.</p>
<p>This kind of list could be used to set font-family styles for CSS, if
 you want to be reasonably sure what the user will see, or it could be 
used just to find a font you like for a particular script. I’m still 
working on the list, and there are some caveats.</p>
<p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/fontlist/">&gt;&gt; See the list</a></p>
<p>Some of the fonts listed above may be disabled on the user’s system. 
I’m making an assumption that someone who reads tibetan will have the 
Tibetan font turned on, but for my articles that explain writing systems
 to people in English, such assumptions may not hold.</p>
<p>The  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/product.aspx?pid=161">list I used to identify Windows fonts</a> is Windows7-specific  and fairly stable, but the   Mac font spans more than one version of Mac OS X, and I could only find an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_included_with_Mac_OS_X">unofficial list of fonts for Snow Leopard</a>,
 and there were some fonts on that list that I didn’t have on my system.
 Where a Mac font is new with Lion (and there are a significant number) 
it is indicated. See the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5098">official list of fonts on Mac OS X Lion</a>.</p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any fonts listed here for a given script that 
aren’t supplied with Windows7 or Mac OS X Snow Leopard/Lion, but there 
are probably supplied fonts that are not yet listed here (typically 
these will be large fonts that cover multiple scripts). In particular, 
note that I haven’t yet made a list of fonts that support Latin, Greek 
and Cyrillic (mainly because there are so many of them and partly 
because I’m wondering how useful it will be.)</p>
<p>The text used is as much as would fit on one line of article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, taken from <a href="http://unicode.org/udhr/index_by_name.html">this Unicode page</a>,
 wherever I could find it. I created a few instances myself, where it 
was missing, and occasionally I resorted to arbitrary lists of 
characters.</p>
<p>You can obtain a character-based version of the text used by looking 
at the source text: look for the title attribute on the section heading.</p>
<p>Things still to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>create sections for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic fonts</li>
<li>check for fonts covering multiple Unicode blocks</li>
<li>figure out how to tell, and how to show which is the system default</li>
<li>work out and show what’s not available in Windows XP</li>
<li>work out what’s new in Lion, and whether it’s worth including them</li>
<li>figure out whether people with different locale setups see different things</li>
<li>recapture all font images that need it at 36px, rather than varying sizes</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: orange;">Update, 19 Feb 2012</h3>
<p>I uploaded a new version of the font list with the following main changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you click on an image you see text with that font applied (if you
 have it on your system, of course). The text can be zoomed from 14px to
 100px (using a nice HTML5 slider, if you have the right browser! [try 
Chrome, Safari or Opera]). This text includes a little Latin text so you
 can see the relationship between that and the script.</li>
<li>All font graphics are now standardised so that text is imaged at a 
font size of 36px. This makes it more difficult to see some fonts 
(unless you can use the zoom text feature), but gives a better idea of 
how fonts vary in default size.</li>
<li>I added a few extra fonts which contained multiple script support.</li>
<li>I split Chinese into Simplified and Traditional sections.</li>
<li>Various other improvements, such as adding real text for N’Ko, 
correcting the Traditional Chinese text, flipping headers to the left 
for RTL fonts, reordering fonts so that similar ones are near to each 
other, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/uniview/">&gt;&gt; Use UniView</a></p>
<p>The major change in this update is the update of the data to support <strong>Unicode version 6.1.0</strong>, which should be released today. (See the list of links to new Unicode blocks below.) </p>
<p>There are also a number of feature and bug related changes.</p>
<p><strong>What UniView does:</strong> Look up and see characters (using
 graphics or fonts) and property information, view whole character 
blocks or custom ranges, select characters to paste into your document, 
paste in and discover unknown characters, search for characters, do 
hex/dec/ncr conversions, highlight character types, etc. etc. Supports 
Unicode 6.1 and written with Web Standards to work on a variety of 
browsers. No need to install anything.</p>
<p><strong>List of changes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One significant change enables you to display information in a 
separate window, rather than overwriting the information currently 
displayed. This can be done by typing/pasting/dragging a set of 
characters or character code values into the new <span class="ui">Popout</span> area and selecting the <img alt=" " src="r12a_blog_files/apply.gif" border="0" align="bottom"> icon alongside the <span class="ui">Characters</span> or <span class="ui">Copy &amp; paste</span> input fields (depending on what you put in the popout window).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two new icons were added to the <span class="ui">Copy &amp; paste</span> area:</p>
<p><img alt="Analyse" src="r12a_blog_files/case-simple.png"> 
Clicking on this will display the characters in the area in the lower 
right part of the page with all relevant characters converted to 
uppercase, lowercase and titlecase. Characters that had no case 
conversion information are also listed.</p>
<p><img alt="Analyse" src="r12a_blog_files/case-detail.png"> 
Clicking on this produces the same kind of output as clicking on the 
icon just above, but shows the mappings for those characters that have 
been changed, eg. e→E.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where  character information displayed in the lower right panel has a
 case or decomposition mapping, UniView now displays the characters 
involved, rather than just giving the hex value(s), eg. Uppercase 
mapping:	0043    C. You will need a font on your system to see the 
characters displayed in this way, but whether or not you have a font, 
this provides a quick and easy way to copy the case-changed character 
(rather than having to copy the hex value and convert it first).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also a new line, slightly further down, when UniView is in 
graphic mode. This line starts with ‘As text:’, and shows the character 
using whatever default font you have on your system. Of course, if you 
don’t have a font that includes that character you won’t see it. This 
has been added to make it easier to copy and paste a character into 
text.</p>

has been added to make it easier to copy and paste a character into 
text.</p>

	<h2 class="post-title">Using unicode-range in font-face in CSS</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Sun 18 Dec 2011 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=6">web</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=fonts">fonts</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>These are notes on using CSS @font-face to gain finer control over 
the fonts applied to characters in particular Unicode ranges of your 
text, without resorting to additional markup. Possibilities and 
problems.</p>
<h3>Changing the font used for certain characters</h3>
<p>Most non-English fonts mix glyphs from different writing systems. 
Usually the font contains glyphs for Latin characters plus a non-Latin 
script, for example English+Japanese, or English+Thai, etc.</p>
<p>Normally the font designer will take care to harmonise the Latin 
script glyphs with the non-Latin, but there may be cases where you want 
to change the design of the glyphs for, say, and embedded script without
 adding markup to your page.</p>
<p>For example, if I apply the MS-Mincho font to some content in Japanese with embedded Latin text I’m likely to see the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/ms-mincho-only.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s suppose I’d like the English text to appear in a different, 
proportionally-spaced font. I could put markup around the English and 
set a class on the markup to apply the font I want, but this is very 
time consuming and bloats your code.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use @font-face. Here is an example:</p>
<figure style="text-align:left">
<pre>@font-face { 
  font-family: myJapanesefont;
  src: local(MS-Mincho);
  }
@font-face {
  font-family: myJapanesefont;
  src: local(Gentium);
  unicode-range: U+41-5A, U+61-7A, U+C0-FF;
  }
p { 
  font-family: myJapanesefont; 
  }
</pre>
</figure>
<p style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; padding: 7px; background-color: #f6f6f6; border-radius: 8px;"><strong>Note:</strong> When specifying <span class="kw">src</span> the <span class="kw">local()</span>
 keyword indicates that font-face should look for the font on the user’s
 system. Of course, to improve interoperability, you may want to specify
 a number of alternatives here, or a downloadable WOFF font.  The most 
interoperable value to use for <span class="kw">local()</span> is the Postscript name of the font. (On the Mac open Font Book, select the font, and choose <span class="ui">Preview &gt; Show Font Information</span> to find this.)</p>
<p>The result would be:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/ms-mincho-gentium.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The first font-face declaration associates the MS-Mincho font with 
the name ‘myJapanesefont’. The second font-face declaration associates 
the Gentium font with the Unicode code points in the Latin-1 letter 
range (of course, you can extend this if you use Latin characters 
outside that range and they are covered by the font).</p>
<p>Note how I was careful to set the unicode-range values to exclude 
punctuation (such as the exclamation mark) that would be used by (and 
harmonised with) the Japanese characters. </p>
<h3>Adding support for new characters to a font</h3>
<p>You can use the same approach for fonts that don’t have support for a particular Unicode range.  </p>
<p>For example, the Nafees Nastaliq font has no glyphs for the Latin 
range (other than digits), so the browser falls back to the system 
default.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/nafees-only.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the following code, I can produce a more pleasant font for the ‘W3C’ part:</p>
<figure style="text-align:left">
<pre>@font-face {; 
  font-family: myUrduFont;
  src: local(NafeesNastaleeq);
  }
@font-face {
  font-family: myUrduFont;
  src: local(BookAntiqua);
  unicode-range: U+30-FF;
  }
div p { 
  font-family: myUrduFont; 
  font-size: 60px;
  }
</pre>
</figure>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/nafees-bookantiqua.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>A big fly in the ointment</h3>
<p>If you look at the ranges in the unicode-range value, you’ll see that
 I kept to just the letters of the alphabet in the Japanese example, and
 the missing glyphs in the Urdu case.</p>
<p>There are a number of characters that are used by all scripts, 
however, and these cause problems because you can’t apply fonts based on
 the context – even if you could work out what that context was.</p>
<p>In the case of the Japanese example above, numbers are left to be 
rendered by the Mincho font, but when those characters appear in the 
Latin text, they look incorrectly sized. Look, for example, at the 3 in 
W3C below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/mincho-gentium-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The same problem arises with spaces and punctuation marks. The 
exclamation mark was left in the Mincho font in the Japanese example 
because, in this case, it is part of the Japanese text. Punctuation of 
this kind, could however be associated with the Latin text. See the 
question mark in this example.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/mincho-baskerville-question.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Even more problematic are the spaces in that example.  They are too 
wide in the Latin text. In Urdu text we have the opposite problem, use 
Urdu space glyphs in Latin text and you don’t see them at all (there 
should be a gap between W3C and i18n below).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/nafees-gentium-space.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With my W3C hat on, I start wondering whether there are any rules we 
can use to apply different glyphs for some characters depending on the 
script context in which they are used, but then I realise that this is 
going to bring in all the problems we already have for bidi text when 
dealing with punctuation or spaces between flows of text in different 
scripts.  I’m not sure it’s a tractable problem without resorting to 
markup to delimit the boundaries. But then, of course, we end up right 
back where we started.</p>
<p>So it seems, disappointingly, that the unicode-range property is 
destined to be of only limited usefulness for me.  That’s a real shame.</p>
<h3>Another small issue</h3>
<p>The examples don’t show major problems, but I assume that sometimes 
the fonts you want to bring together using font-face will have very 
different aspect ratios, so you may need to use something like 
font-size-adjust to balance the size of the fonts being used.</p>
<h3>Browser support</h3>
<p>The CSS code above worked for me in Chrome and Safari on Mac OS X 
10.6. but didn’t work in Firefox or Opera. Nor did it work in IE9 on 
Windows7.</p>

			<p>The ‘unicode-range’ descriptor for @font-face rules simply provides a mechanism for selectively downloading font data for a set of fonts that support a wide range of scripts.  It is *not* a way of stitching together fonts and making them work well together.  That’s the job of a good type designer!!  There are lots of folks these days focused on problems of how to harmonize type systems across scripts.  These sorts of designers could design a set of typefaces that would stitch together well.</p>
<p>And if you’re trying to combine anything with MS Mincho, er, well, good luck and godspeed…</p>

			<p>Thanks for the explanation of unicode-range. Today (Oct 2013) FF still does not support this descriptor. I’ve written a jQuery plugin to emulate it: <a href="https://github.com/infojunkie/jquery-unicode-range" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/infojunkie/jquery-unicode-range</a>. </p>
<p>You can also vote on the FF feature request to bump it up: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475891" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475891</a></p>

	<h2 class="post-title">What is XHTML5?</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Mon 5 Dec 2011 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=6">web</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>There appears to be some confusion about XHTML1.0 vs XHTML5. Here is my best shot at an explanation of what XHTML5 is.</p>
<div class="floatright" style="float:right; margin-left: 2em; width: 30%; color:#999999;">*
 This post is written for people with some background in MIME types and 
html/xml formats. In case that’s not you, this may give you enough to 
follow the idea: ‘served as’ means sent from a server to the browser 
with a MIME type declaration in the HTTP protocol header that says that 
the content of the page is HTML (text/html) or XML (eg. <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>). <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/serving-xhtml/#mime" target="_blank">See examples and more explanations</a>.</div>
<p>XHTML5 is an HTML5 document served as* <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> (or another XML mime type). The syntax rules for XHTML5 documents are simply those rules given by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/" target="_blank">XML specification</a>. The vocabulary (elements and attributes) is defined by the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/" target="_blank">HTML5 spec</a>.</p>
<p>Anything served as <code>text/html</code> is not XHTML5.</p>
<p>Note that HTML5 (without the X) can be written in a style that looks 
like XML syntax. For example, using a / in empty elements (eg. <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>), or using quotes around attributes.  But code written this way is still HTML5, not XHTML5, if it is served as <code>text/html</code>.</p>
<p>There are normally other differences between HTML5 and XHTML5.  For 
example, XHTML5 documents may have an XML declaration at the start of 
the document. HTML5 documents cannot have that.  XHTML5 documents are 
likely to have a more complicated doctype (to facilitate XML 
processing).  And XHTML5 documents will have an xmlns attribute on the 
html tag.  There are a few other HTML5 features that are not compatible 
with XML, and must be avoided.</p>
<p>Similar differences existed between HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0.  
However, moving on from XHTML 1.0 will typically involve a subtle but 
significant shift in thinking.  You might have written XHTML 1.0 with no
 intention of serving it as anything other than <code>text/html</code>. 
XHTML in the XHTML 1.0 sense tended to be seen  largely as a difference 
in syntax; it was originally designed to be served as XML, but (with 
some customisations to suit HTML documents) could be, and usually was, 
served with an HTML mime type. XHTML in the XHTML5 sense, means HTML5 
documents served with an XML mime type (and appropriate customisations 
to suit XML documents), ie. it’s the MIME type, not the syntax, that 
makes it XHTML.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Polyglot documents.  A polyglot document contains 
markup that is the subset of HTML5 and XML that can be processed as 
either HTML or XHTML, and can be served as either <code>text/html</code> or <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, ie. as either HTML5 or XHTML5, without any errors or warnings in either case.  The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-xhtml-author-guide/" target="_blank">polyglot spec</a>
 defines the things which allow this compatibility (such as using no XML
 declaration, proper casing of element names, etc.), and which things to
 avoid.  It also mandates at least one additional extra, ie. disallowing
 UTF-16 encoded documents. </p>

<p>so, if I am a client, how do I make the difference between XHTML1.1 and XHTML5? Both return application/xhtml+xml. Is there a standard way to do that?</p>

			<p>The bad news on html5 is that some people think they traveled back to 1997 and write smelly markup. That is where the xml specs should be the way to go. I write regular html5 markup, but keep the xml specs in mind. The source is much more readable and just more … elegant 🙂 One more benefit of this approach is that you can port to several xml formats very quickly.</p>
<p>Nice article.</p>

			<p>Because I am not concerned with backward compatibility and happily accept the discipline of application/xhtml+xml, I was wondering whether it would be proper to amend apache’s HTTP_ACCEPT by removing ‘text/html’ and force serving everything as application/xhtml+xml. The idea is to ONLY accept that type (no fall-back) and have php notify the user agent accordingly. Failing that, I guess content negotiation is my only alternative, which means I do not understand what xhtml/xml must be defined.</p>
<p>I am struggling for a controlled, disciplined environment at the outset. I have used xhtml1.1 in the past without problems. (X)HTML5 is definitely my goal.</p>

	<h2 class="post-title">How to generate a list of Unicode characters with names and/or codepoints</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Tue 25 Oct 2011 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=uniview">uniview</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>One of the more useful features of <a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/uniview/" target="_blank" style="font-size: 120%;">UniView</a>
 is its ability to list the characters in a string with names and 
codepoints. This is particularly useful when you can’t tell what a 
string of characters contains because you don’t have a font, or because 
the script is too complex, etc.</p>
<div style="float:left; margin: 0 20px 10px 7.5%;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/ishida-nastaliq.png" alt="'ishida' in Persian in  nastaliq font style"></div>
<p>For example, I was recently sent an email where my name was written in Persian as <span style="font-family: IranNastaliq, 'Nafees Nastaleeq', serif; font-size: 120%;">ایشی‌دا</span>. The image shows how it looks in a nastaliq font. </p>
<p style="clear:both;">To see the component characters, drop the string into UniView’s <span class="ui">Copy &amp; Paste</span> field and click on the <img src="r12a_blog_files/apply.html" alt="downwards pointing arrow"> icon.  Here is the result:</p>
<p><img src="r12a_blog_files/ishida-nastaliq-list.png" alt="list of characters"></p>
<p>Note how you can now see that there’s an invisible control character 
in the string.  Note also that you see a graphic image for each 
character, which is a big help if the string you are investigating is 
just a sequence of boxes on your system.</p>
<p>Not only can you discover characters in this way, but you can create 
lists of characters which can be pasted into another document, and 
customise the format of those lists.</p>
<h3>Pasting the list elsewhere</h3>
<p>If you select this list and paste it into a document, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>  0627  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
  06CC  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
  0634  ARABIC LETTER SHEEN
  06CC  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
  200C  ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
  062F  ARABIC LETTER DAL
  0627  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
</pre>
</figure>
<p>You can make the characters appear by deselecting <span class="ui">Use graphics</span> on the <span class="ui">Look up</span> tab. (Of course, you need an arabic font to see the list as intended.)</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>ا  ‎0627  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
ی  ‎06CC  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
ش  ‎0634  ARABIC LETTER SHEEN
ی  ‎06CC  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
‌  ‎200C  ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
د  ‎062F  ARABIC LETTER DAL
ا  ‎0627  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
</pre>
</figure>
<h3>Customising the list format</h3>
<p>What may be less obvious is that you can also customise the format of this list using the settings under the <span class="ui">Options</span> tab.  For example, using the <span class="ui">List format</span> settings, I can produce a list that moves the character column between the number and the name, like this:</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>  0627  ا  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
  ‎06CC  ی  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
  ‎0634  ش  ARABIC LETTER SHEEN
  ‎06CC  ی  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
  ‎200C  ‌  ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
  ‎062F  د  ARABIC LETTER DAL
  ‎0627  ا  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
</pre>
</figure>
<p>Or I can remove one or more columns from the list, such as:</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>  ا  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
  ی  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
  ش  ARABIC LETTER SHEEN
  ی  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
  ‌  ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
  د  ARABIC LETTER DAL
  ا  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
</pre>
</figure>
<p>With the option <span class="ui">Show U+ in lists</span> I can also add or remove the U+ before the codepoint value.  For example, this lets me produce the following list:</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>  ‎U+0627  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
  ‎U+06CC  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
  ‎U+0634  ARABIC LETTER SHEEN
  ‎U+06CC  ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH
  ‎U+200C  ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
  ‎U+062F  ARABIC LETTER DAL
  ‎U+0627  ARABIC LETTER ALEF
</pre>
</figure>
<h3>Other lists in UniView</h3>
<p>We’ve shown how you can make a list of characters in the <span class="ui">Cut &amp; Paste</span>
 box, but don’t forget that you can create lists for a Unicode block, 
custom range of characters, search list results, or list of codepoint 
values, etc.  And not only that, but you can filter lists in various 
ways.</p>
<p>Here is just one quick example of how you can obtain a list of numbers for the Devanagari script.  </p>
<ol>
<li>On the <span class="ui">Look up</span> tab, select Devanagari from the <span class="ui">Unicode block</span> pull down list.</li>
<li>Select <span class="ui">Show range as list</span> and deselect (optional) <span class="ui">Use graphics</span>.</li>
<li>Under the <span class="ui">Filter</span> tab, select Number from the <span class="ui">Show properties</span> pull down list.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="ui">Make list from highlights</span></li>
</ol>
<p>You end up with the following list, that you can paste into your document.</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>०  ‎0966  DEVANAGARI DIGIT ZERO
१  ‎0967  DEVANAGARI DIGIT ONE
२  ‎0968  DEVANAGARI DIGIT TWO
३  ‎0969  DEVANAGARI DIGIT THREE
४  ‎096A  DEVANAGARI DIGIT FOUR
५  ‎096B  DEVANAGARI DIGIT FIVE
६  ‎096C  DEVANAGARI DIGIT SIX
७  ‎096D  DEVANAGARI DIGIT SEVEN
८  ‎096E  DEVANAGARI DIGIT EIGHT
९  ‎096F  DEVANAGARI DIGIT NINE
</pre>
</figure>
<p>(Of course, you can also customise the layout of this list as described in the previous section.)</p>

<h3>Reversing the process: from list to string</h3>
<p>To complete the circle, you can also cut &amp; paste any of the lists
 in the blog text above into UniView, to explore each character’s 
properties or recreate the string.  </p>
<p>Select one of the lists above and paste it into the <span class="ui">Characters</span> input field on the <span class="ui">Look up</span> tab. Hit the <img src="r12a_blog_files/apply.html" alt="downwards pointing arrow"> icon alongside, and UniView will recreate the list for you. Click on each character to view detailed information about it.</p>
<p>If you want to recreate the string from the list, simply click on the <img src="r12a_blog_files/tochar.html" alt="upwards pointing arrow"> icon below the <span class="ui">Copy &amp; paste</span> box, and the list of characters will be reconstituted in the box as a string.</p>
<p>Voila!</p>
