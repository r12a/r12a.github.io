          <p>I’ve been developing some small utilities in PHP to help me geotag my
            photos.  First up for mention here is a tool for converting latitude 
            and longitude to decimal format and to the tags needed for Flickr.  I 
            think it may be of use to other people than just me.</p>
          <p>The following input formats are acceptable:</p>
          <p> * Any arrangement that includes at least one of the following 
            characters ° ‘ ” or , and lists figures in the order degrees, minutes, 
            seconds (where the last two are optional).<br>
            * Decimal formats – useful for just formatting as flickr geotags.<br>
            * Use of N,S,E,W (any case and any location) or minus signs.</p>
          <p>The following decimal output formats are provided:</p>
          <p> * latitude longitude: this is arranged in such a way that you 
            could cut and paste the whole thing as one, eg. into, say, Google 
            Earth’s search field to find a location quickly<br>
            * geotags for Flickr: this provides the regular geotag, lat= and 
            lon= tags plus a fourth combination tag in a format that enables to 
            create tags with a single cut and paste</p>

          <p>Someone who uses the pickers for cataloguing the Asian language 
            collection in a UK library asked me to provide a Gujarati picker.  Since
            he was suitably flattering about the other pickers, I thought I ought 
            to oblige.</p>
          <p>This picker includes all the characters in the Unicode Gujarati block.</p>
          <p>The default shows all characters as images due to the rarity of 
            Gujarati fonts. Consonants are mostly in a typical articulatory 
            arrangement, vowels are aligned with vowel signs, and digits are in 
            keypad order. I have not implemented any highlighting of similar 
            characters, since I put this together very quickly.</p>

          <p>Version 4.1.0b is a minor update, but adds some useful functionality.</p>
          <p>Changes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provided a way to start up UniView with a particular block and/or 
              character displayed as a table in the lower 				panels. This should be 
              particularly useful for pointing a person to a particular Unicode block 
              or character in a URI.  For example, if you wanted to point someone to 
              UniView so that they immediately find the Greek and Coptic block, and a 
              description of U+0E33: THAI CHARACTER SARA AM, you could put the 
              following link in your email or page: <a href="http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/uniview/?block=greek-and-coptic&amp;char=0e33">http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/uniview/?block=greek-and-coptic&amp;char=0e33</a></li>
            <li>Added a link to the <a href="http://www.decodeunicode.org/">decodeUnicode wiki</a> for each character that is displayed in the right-hand panel. This is a
              wiki where people can contribute information about Unicode blocks and 
              characters. It is developed at the Department of Design at the 
              University of Applied Sciences in Mainz. “The project is supported by 
              the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and has the 
              objectives of creating a basis for fundamental typographic research and 
              facilitating a textual approach to the characters of the world for all 
              computer users.”</li>
            <li>Fixed a couple of minor bugs in the CSS.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Added some glyphs that were missing by comparing with the information at the <a href="http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html">IPA home page</a>.</li>
            <li>Added image/character switch, but changed it so that combining characters are only ever shown as images.</li>
            <li>Combining graphics are now distinguished by a pale blue background.</li>
            <li>Added some links and information to the bottom of the page.</li>

            W3C i18n Working Group would like to hear from you if you have some 
            knowledge/thoughts in this area. We would like to gather information 
            about the usefulness, in general, of the ::first-letter pseudo-element 
            in non-Latin scripts, and any particular issues or differences arising 
            from the different characteristics of the scripts.Please send your 
            comments to www-international @ w3.org<br>
            Archive and subscription: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/</a></div>
          <p>The latest working draft of CSS3 Selectors proposes the ::first-letter pseudo-element.</p>
          <p>See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-selectors-20051215/#first-letter">http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-selectors-20051215/#first-letter</a></p>
          <p>The ::first-letter pseudo-element represents the first letter of the 
            first line of a block, if it is not preceded by any other content (such 
            as images or inline tables) on its line.</p>
          <p>It allows that first letter to be styled individually, without markup. It may be used for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-selectors-20051215/#first-letter">“initial caps” and “drop caps”</a>, which are common typographical effects in text in Latin script.</p>
          <p>We commented to the CSS Working Group that they need to define 
            ‘letter’ more carefully, and proposed that they specify that ‘letter’ 
            equates to ‘default grapheme cluster’, as described in the Unicode 
            Standard Annex #29.</p>
          <p>See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries</a></p>
          <p>(A rough and ready explanation of this is that base characters and any following combining characters are styled together. So</p>
          <p>0065: e LATIN SMALL LETTER E + 0301: ́ COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT</p>
          <p>would be handled as a single letter.)</p>
          <p>We also suggested that implementors should then be encouraged to 
            provide tailored algorithms on a per language basis to cope with 
            anomolies, particularly such as may occur in non-Latin scripts.</p>
          <p>Here are some initial questions:</p>
          <p><strong>[1] Are there scripts that would never use this approach?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>[2] We mention ‘initial caps’ and ‘drop caps’ above.  What 
            other types of styling would be commonly applied in other scripts if 
            this feature were available?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>[3] What script features would cause difficulties, eg 
            syllabic groupings (see the example of indic script example below), 
            ligatures, cursive text (eg. Arabic, Urdu, etc.), and how would the 
            script normally deal with them?</strong></p>
          <p>Please send your comments to www-international @ w3.org<br>
            Archive: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/</a></p>
          <p>————</p>
          <p>What follows are some examples of questions that spring to mind.</p>
          <p>SYLLABIC INDIC SCRIPTS</p>
          <p>In the Hindi word स्थिति (‘sthiti’) the sequence of characters in the first syllable is as follows in memory:</p>
          <p>0938:   स  DEVANAGARI LETTER SA<br>
            094D:   ्  DEVANAGARI SIGN VIRAMA<br>
            0925:   थ  DEVANAGARI LETTER THA<br>
            093F:   ि  DEVANAGARI VOWEL SIGN I</p>
          <p>The displayed text, however, is <img alt="The first syllable of the word 'sthiti' in Hindi, showing the positions of the characters after display." src="r12a_blog_files/sthiti.gif"></p>
          <p>Note how the vowel sign appears to the left of the first character, not the third.</p>
          <p>The default grapheme clusters here are, I believe, 0938+094D, then each of the following two characters.</p>
          <p>Would Devanagari-based languages use special styling for initial 
            syllables?  If so, would they actually apply the styling to the vowel 
            sign alone, or to the whole syllable?</p>
          <p>LIGATURES</p>
          <p>If a script styles the ‘first letter’, but that letter is part of a 
            ligature (ie. a single glyph representing more than one underlying 
            character), would it be ok to split the ligature, or should the other 
            characters that compose the ligature also be styled?</p>
          <p>CURSIVE SCRIPTS</p>
          <p>Since Arabic and Mongolian letters in a word are normally joined, has first letter styling been used at all in these scripts?</p>
          <p>CHINESE, JAPANESE, KOREAN</p>
          <p>Do languages using these scripts do first letter styling?</p>
          <p>RUSSIAN, GREEK, ARMENIAN, etc.</p>
          <p>Is first letter styling common practise in these scripts too?</p>

          <p>The paper refers to standard topics such as character encoding and

            emphasis and style conventions, handling of citations, use of text in 
            attribute values, and the need for an element like HTML’s SPAN. In 
            addition, other topics that have traditionally been associated with 
            translation of user interface messages become applicable due to the 
            nature of XML documents. These include the provision of designer’s 
            notes, identification of non-translatable text, and use of element ids

          <p><a href="http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/uniview/">New version</a></p>
          <p>Although the difference between 4.1 and 4.1.0a doesn’t look like much, this is a substantial update.  I also updated the <a href="http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/uniview/help.html">help/user guide</a>.</p>
          <p>Changes: </p>
          <p>Added support for Unicode version 4.1.0.</p>
          <p>Retrieves graphics from decodeunicode.org rather than the 
            slow-loading and sparse graphics that were available from the Unicode 
            site. Also added my own graphics where decodeunicode has gaps.</p>
          <p>Moved the files to PHP. This enables a different approach to the 
            inclusion of user-defined notes that now works on IE and Opera, too.</p>
          <p>Another benefit of using PHP is that you can now prep the conversion 
            page with data in the ‘Code point’ or ‘Cut &amp; paste’ fields. By 
            clicking on the appropriate icon, the conversion page will now open with
            the conversions already done for the relevant field.</p>
          <p>Yet another benefit of PHP is that, if you really want to, you can 
            now set various preferences related to the intial look and feel by 
            specifying them as query parameters when you call UniView.</p>
          <p>NOTE: If you want to be able to download UniView to your hard drive 
            and you don’t have a server and PHP, let me know. If enough people ask 
            for it, I will create a downloadable zipped package again that will work
            without PHP (and without the additional notes feature). I will also 
            post notes on how to customise various aspects of the setup.</p>
          <p>Rearranged the top of the page to allow UniView to be used in narrower windows.</p>

          <p>This picker includes all characters in the Unicode 4.0 Ethiopic block. It does not cover additions in Unicode version 4.1. </p>
          <p>(Before creating a full Ethiopic picker, I need to get a font that 
            covers all the new characters, and I need to figure out how to best fit 
            the new characters into the current arrangement.)</p>
          <p>Letters are arranged in the Unicode code page order, which is aligned
            with the traditional consonant-vowel matrix.  I didn’t actually use a 
            table, to save space.  If you have strong views on the layout, send me

          <p>[<a href="http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/tutorial/">new version</a>]</p>
          <p>In preparation for my full-day tutorial at WWW2005 I’ve been creating
            and renovating presentations.  As a result, the format of this tutorial
            has been reworked to fit the style I have recently developed for 
            tutorials on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/">W3C Internationalization</a> site.</p>
          <p>The text remains the same, but you can now view slides as a single 
            document (good for printing),  or as individual slides with XHTML-based 
            notes.  The slides themselves are graphics, so you can see what I’m 
            trying to show you, but there’s also a text only version of each slide. 
            There’s also a new overview, to help you jump around easily.</p>
          <p>I had wanted to also provide SVG slides, but the SVG export utility 
            in the new version of Open Office (2.0 beta) takes control of 
            positioning the text in a way that doesn’t support combining characters 
            and shaping etc properly.  Since my talk is about features that need to 
            be supported for support of complex scripts, this actually provides an 
            interesting object lesson!  🙁  Maybe when I have more time I’ll upload 
            them.</p>

          <p>Supports Unicode 4.0 and rewritten with Web Standards to work on a 
            variety of browsers. – this is still work in progress and has some known
            bugs (esp surrogates), but I use it all the time.</p>
          <p>Initially downloads about 1Mb of Unicode data, so you should use a 
            fast connection. Once it’s cached you’re ok. Alternatively, download the

          <p>The HTML specification suggests that the link element can be used by

          <p>Andrew Cunningham and I wrote a test for this. Here is a summary of
