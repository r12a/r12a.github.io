	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Mon 10 Oct 2011 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>I created a new HTML5-based template for our <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articlelist">W3C Internationalization articles</a>
 recently, and I’ve just received some requests to translate documents 
into Arabic and Hebrew, so I had to get around to updating the bidi 
style sheets. (To make it quicker to develop styles, I create the style 
sheet for ltr pages first, and only when that is working well do I 
create the rtl style sheet info.)</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts about how to deal with style sheets for both right-to-left (rtl) and left-to-right (ltr) documents.</p>
<h3>What needs changing?</h3>
<p>Converting a style sheet is a little more involved than using a 
global search and replace to convert left to right, and vice versa. 
While this may catch many of the things that need changing, it won’t 
catch all, and it could also introduce errors into the style sheet.</p>
<p>For example, I had selectors called .topleft and .bottomright in my 
style sheet. These, of course, shouldn’t be changed.  There may also be 
occasional situations where you don’t want to change the direction of a 
particular block.</p>
<p>Another thing to look out for: I tend to use -left and -right a lot 
when setting things like margins, but where I have set something like <code>margin: 1em 32% .5em 7.5%;</code>
 you can’t just use search and replace, and you have to carefully scour 
the whole of the main stylesheet to find the instances where the right 
and left margins are not balanced.</p>
<p>There is a web service called <a href="http://cssjanus.commoner.com/" target="_blank">CSSJanus</a>
 that can apply a little intelligence to convert most of what you need. 
 You still have to use with care, but it does come with a convention to 
prevent conversion of properties where needed (you can disable CSSJanus 
from running on an entire class or any rule within a class by prepending
 a <code>/* @noflip */</code> comment before the rule(s) you want CSSJanus to ignore).</p>
<p>Note also that there are other things that may need changing besides 
the right and left values. For example, some of the graphics on our 
template need to be flipped (such as the dog-ear icon in the top corner 
of the page).</p>
<p>CSS may provide a way to do this in the future, but it is still only a
 proposal in a First Public Working Draft at the moment. (It would 
involve writing a selector such as <code>#site-navigation:dir(rtl) { background-image: url(standards-corner-rtl.png); }</code>.</p>
<h3>Approach 1: extracting changed properties to an auxiliary style sheet</h3>
<p>For the old template I have a secondary, bidi style sheet that I load
 after the main style sheet. This bidi style sheet contains a copy of 
just the rules in the main style sheet that needed changing and 
overwrites the styles in the main style sheet.  These changes were 
mainly to margin, padding, and text-align properties, though there were 
also some others, such as positioning, background and border properties.</p>
<p>The cons of this approach were:</p>
<ol>
<li>it’s a pain to create and maintain a second style sheet in the first place</li>
<li>it’s an even bigger pain to remember to copy any relevant changes in
 the main style sheet to the bidi style sheet, not least because the 
structure is different, and it’s a little harder to locate things</li>
<li>everywhere that the main style sheet declared, say, a left margin 
without declaring a value for the right margin, you have to figure out 
what that other margin should be and add it to the bidi style sheet. For
 example, if a figure has just margin-left: 32%, that will be converted 
to margin-right: 32%, but because the bidi style sheet hasn’t 
overwritten the main style sheet’s margin-left value, the Arabic page 
will end up with both margins set to 32%, and a much thinner figure than
 desired.  To prevent this, you need to figure out what all those 
missing values should be, which is typically not straightforward, and 
add them explicitly to the bidi style sheet.</li>
<li>downloading a second style sheet and overwriting styles leads to 
higher bandwidth consumption and more processing work for the rtl pages.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Approach 2: copying the whole style sheet and making changes</h3>
<p>This is the approach that I’m trying for the moment. Rather than 
painstakingly picking out just the lines that changed, I take a copy of 
the whole main style sheet, and load that with the article <em>instead</em>
 of the main style sheet.  Of course, I still have to change all the 
lefts to rights, and vice versa, and change all the graphics, etc.  But I
 don’t need to add additional rules in places where I previously only 
specified one side margin, padding, etc. </p>
<p>We’ll see how it works out.  Of course, the big problem here is that <em>any</em>
 change I make to the main style sheet has to be copied to the bidi 
style sheet, whether it is related to direction or not. Editing in two 
places is definitely going to be a pain, and breaks the big advantage 
that style sheets usually give you of applying changes with a single 
edit. Hopefully, if I’m careful, CSSJanus will ease that pain a little.</p>
<p>Another significant advantage should be that the page loads faster, 
because you don’t have to download two style sheets and overwrite a good
 proportion of the main style sheet to display the page.</p>
<p>And finally, as long as I format things exactly the same way, by 
running a diff program I may be able to spot where I forgot to change 
things in a way that’s not possible with approach 1.</p>
<h3>Approach 3: using :lang and a single file</h3>
<p>On the face of it, this seems like a better approach. Basically you 
have a single style sheet, but when you have a pair of rules such as <code>p { margin-right: 32%; margin-left: 7.5%;}</code> you add another line that says <code>p:lang(ar) { margin-left: 32%; margin-right: 7.5%; }</code>.</p>
<p>For small style sheets, this would probably work fine, but in my case
 I see some cons with this approach, which is why I didn’t take it:</p>
<ol>
<li>there are so many places where these extra lines need to be added 
that it will make the style sheet much harder to read, and this is made 
worse because the <code>p:lang(ar)</code> in the example above would actually need to be <code>p:lang(ar), p:lang(he), p:lang(ur), p:lang(fa), p:lang(dv) ...</code>,
 which is getting very messy, but also significantly pumps up the 
bandwidth and processing requirements compared with approach 2 (and not 
only for rtl docs).</li>
<li>you still have to add all those missing values we talked about in 
approach 1 that were not declared in the part of the style sheet dealing
 with ltr scripts</li>
<li>the list of languages could be long, since there is no way to say 
“make this rule work for any language with a predominantly rtl script”, 
and obscures those rules that really are language specific, such as for 
font settings, that I’d like to be able to find quickly when maintaining
 the style sheet</li>
<li>you really need to use the :lang() selector for this, and although 
it works on all recent versions of major browsers, it doesn’t work on, 
for example, IE6</li>
</ol>
<p>Having said that, I may use this approach for the few things that 
CSSJanus can’t convert, such as flipping images. That will hopefully 
mean that I can produce the alternative stylesheet in approach 2 just by
 running through CSSJanus. (We’ll see if I’m right in the long run, but 
so far so good…)</p>
<h3>Approach 4: what I’d really like to do</h3>
<p>The cleanest way to reduce most of these problems would be to add 
some additional properties or values so that if you wanted to you could 
replace </p>
<p><code>p { margin-right: 32%; margin-left: 7.5%; text-align: left; }</code> </p>
<p>with</p>
<p><code>p { margin-start: 32%; margin-end: 7.5%; text-align: start; }</code></p>
<p>Where start refers to the left for ltr documents and right for rtl docs. (And end is the converse.)</p>
<p>This would mean that that one rule would work for both ltr and rtl pages and I wouldn’t have to worry about most of the above.  </p>
<p>The new properties have been strongly recommended to the CSS WG 
several times over recent years, but have been blocked mainly by people 
who fear that a proliferation of properties or values is confusing to 
users. There may be some issues to resolve with regards to the cascade, 
but I’ve never really understood why it’s so hard to use start and end. 
Nor have I met any users of RTL scripts (or vertical scripts, for that 
matter) who find using start and end more confusing than using right and
 left – in fact, on the contrary, the ones I have talked with are 
actively pushing for the introduction of start and end to make their 
life easier. But it seems we are currently still at an impasse.</p>
<h4 style="margin-left:7.5%;">text-align</h4>
<p>Similarly, a start and end value for text-align would be very useful.
 In fact, such a value is in the CSS3 Text module and is already 
recognised by latest versions of Firefox, Safari and Chrome, but 
unfortunately not IE8 or Opera, so I can’t really use it yet.</p>
<p>In my style sheet, due to some bad design on my part, what I actually
 needed most of the time was a value that says “turn off justify and 
apply the current default” – ie. align the text to left or right 
depending on the current direction of the text. Unfortunately, I think 
that we have to wait for full support of the start and end values to do 
that.  Applying text-align:left to unjustify, say, p elements in a 
particular context causes problems if some of those p elements are rtl 
and others ltr.  This is because, unlike mirroring margins or padding, 
text-align is more closely associated with the text itself than with 
page geometry. (I resolved this by reworking the style sheet so that I 
don’t need to unjustify elements, but I ought to follow <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-i18n-html-tech-bidi-20090908/#tech-textalign">my own advice</a> more in future, and avoid using text-align unless absolutely necessary.)</p>

			<p>Approach 4 is the most logical (no pun intended) way. It would also allowed for better styling with both LTR and RTL content together. Also *-start and *-end makes more sense in vertical writing-mode.</p>

			<p>We went for a similar approach to 3 in the past: instead of using the lang pseudo-class we added an .rtl class to the body serverside. We also had presentational class names like .left and .right (for floats) and .tar and .tal (for text-align). Not ideal but it sort of worked. I agree that just having -start and -end would be very useful.</p>
<p>Another variation could be achieved by using a CSS preprocessor like LESS or SASS. The output would be the same as approach 3, but authoring and maintenance could be simpler?</p>

			<p>I was planning to use ‘start’ and ‘end’ values for my CSS template, but I noticed that it still not supported in Opera.<br>
So I had to use ‘:lang’ with ALL ltr languages:<br>
<a href="http://beta.richstyle.org/demo-web-ar.php" rel="nofollow">http://beta.richstyle.org/demo-web-ar.php</a><br>
Also, the W3C CSS validator returned this warning:<br>

			<p>When you can change the HTML code alongside the CSS, the more practical way is to set specific classes for each language direction, say for instance:</p>
<p>#header-ltr {<br>
    background:url(images/bg_top-ltr.jpg) no-repeat;<br>
}<br>
#header-rtl {<br>
    background:url(images/bg_top-rtl.jpg) no-repeat;<br>
}</p>
<p>You end up with quite a big bidi style sheet, but with some compression the total weight of the file is not much bigger than for only one language direction.<br>
Of course, it is way easier to start your project with language direction in mind than to change it afterwards.</p>

			<p>I personally use something similar to Approach 3, but depending on *dir* instead of *lang*. That way you only need to define one style per text direction. E.g.:</p>
<p>[dir=rtl] th {<br>
    text-align: right;<br>
}<br>
[dir=ltr] th {<br>
    text-align: left;<br>
}</p>
<p>The only con with that is that [dir] makes that declaration have a higher specificity.</p>

	<h2 class="post-title">Notes on CSS Hyphenation</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Tue 4 Oct 2011 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=layout">layout</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>In the phrase “Zusätzlich erleichtert PLS die Eingrenzung von 
Anwendungen, indem es Aussprachebelange von anderen Teilen der Anwendung
 abtrennt.” (“In addition, PLS facilitates the localization of 
applications by separating pronunciation concerns from other parts of 
the application.”) there are many long words.  To fit these in narrow 
columns (coming soon to the Web via CSS) or on mobile devices, it would 
help to automatically hyphenate them.</p>
<p>Other major browsers already supported soft-hyphens when Firefox 5 
implemented FF support. Soft hyphens provide a manual workaround for 
breaking long words, but more recently browsers such as Firefox, Safari 
and Chrome have begun to support the CSS3 hyphens property, with 
hyphenation dictionaries for a range of languages, to support (or 
disable, if needed) automatic hyphenation.  (Note, however, that 
Aussprachebelange is incorrectly hyphenated in the example from Safari 
5.1 on Lion OS shown above. It is hyphenated as Aussprac- hebelange. 
Some refinement is clearly still needed at this stage.)</p>
<p>For hyphenation to work correctly, the text must be marked up with 
language information, using the language tags described earlier.  This 
is because hyphenation rules vary by language, not by script. The 
description of the hyphens property in CSS says “Correct automatic 
hyphenation requires a hyphenation resource appropriate to the language 
of the text being broken. The UA is therefore only required to 
automatically hyphenate text for which the author has declared a 
language (e.g. via HTML lang or XML xml:lang) and for which it has an 
appropriate hyphenation resource.”</p>
<p>This post is a place for me to dump a few URIs related to this topic, so that i can find them again later.</p>

	<h2 class="post-title">html5’s new &lt;bdi&gt; element</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Wed 20 Jul 2011 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>The html5 specification contains a bunch of new features to support 
bidirectional text in web pages.  Language written with right-to-left 
scripts, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Thaana, Urdu, etc., commonly 
mixes in words or phrases in English or some other language that uses a 
left-to-right script.  The result is called bidirectional or bidi text.</p>
<p>HTML 4.01 coupled with the Unicode Bidirectional algorithm already 
does a pretty good job of managing bidirectional text, but there are 
still some problems when dealing with embedded text from user input or 
from stored data.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Here’s an example where the names of restaurants are added to a page 
from a database. This is the code, with the Hebrew shown using ASCII:</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>&lt;p&gt;Aroma - 3 reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PURPLE PIZZA - 5 reviews&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</figure>
<p>And here’s what you’d expect to see, and what you’d actually see.</p>
<div class="figure" style="width: 200px; float:left;text-align: center; display:block; margin-left:7.5%;margin-right: 10px;">
<p><img src="r12a_blog_files/restaurant-right.png" title="AZZIP ELPRUP - 5 reviews" alt="AZZIP ELPRUP - 5 reviews"></p><figcaption>What it should look like.</figcaption></div>
<div class="figure" style="width: 200px; float:left;text-align: center; display:block; margin-left:10px;margin-right: 10px;">
<p><img src="r12a_blog_files/restaurant-wrong.png" title="5 - AZZIP ELPRUP reviews" alt="5 - AZZIP ELPRUP reviews"></p><figcaption>What it actually looks like.</figcaption></div>
<p><br style="clear:both;"></p>
<p>The problem arises because the browser thinks that the ” – 5″ is part
 of the Hebrew text. This is what the Unicode Bidi Algorithm tells it to
 do, and usually it is correct.  Not here though.</p>
<p>So the question is how to fix it?</p>
<h3><code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> to the rescue</h3>
<p>The trick is to use the <span class="kw">bdi</span> element around the text to isolate it from its surrounding content. (<span class="kw">bdi</span> stands for ‘bidi-isolate’.)</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>&lt;p&gt;&lt;bdi&gt;Aroma&lt;/bdi&gt; - 3 reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;bdi&gt;PURPLE PIZZA&lt;/bdi&gt; - 5 reviews&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</figure>
<p>The bidi algorithm now treats the Hebrew and “- 5” as separate chunks
 of content, and orders those chunks per the direction of the overall 
context, ie. from left-to-right here.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the example above has bdi around the name Aroma 
too. Of course, you don’t actually need that, but it won’t do any harm. 
On the other hand, it means you can write a script in something like PHP
 that says:</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>foreach $restaurant echo "&lt;bdi&gt;$restaurant['name']&lt;/bdi&gt; - $restaurant['reviews'] reviews"; 
</pre>
</figure>
<p>This means you can handle any name that comes out of the database, whatever script it is in.</p>
<p><span class="kw">bdi</span> isn’t supported fully by all browsers yet, but it’s coming.</p>
<h3>Things to avoid</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Using the <span class="kw">dir</span> attribute on a <span class="kw">span</span> element</dt>
<dd>
<p>You may think that something like this would work:</p>
<figure class="code">
<pre>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=rtl&gt;PURPLE PIZZA&lt;/span&gt; - 5 reviews&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</figure>
<p>But actually that won’t make any difference, because it doesn’t isolate the content of the span from what surrounds it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Using Unicode control characters</dt>
<dd>
<p>You could actually produce the desired result in this case using U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK just before the hyphen.</p>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;PURPLE PIZZA &amp;lrm;- 5 reviews&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>For a number of reasons, however, <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-controls">it is better to use markup</a>.
 Markup is part of the structure of the document, it avoids the need to 
add logic to the application to choose between LRM and RLM, and it 
doesn’t cause search failures like the Unicode characters sometimes do. 
 Also, the markup can neatly deal with any unbalanced embedding controls
 inadvertently left in the embedded text.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Using CSS</dt>
<dd>
<p>CSS has also been updated to allow you to isolate text, but you should <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup">always use dedicated markup for bidi rather than CSS</a>.
  This means that the information about the directionality of the 
document is preserved even in situations where the CSS is not available.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Using <span class="kw">bdo</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Although it sounds similar, and it’s used for bidi text too, the <span class="kw">bdo</span> element is very different. It <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/bidi-xhtml/#Slide0420">overrides the bidi algorithm altogether</a> for the text it contains, and doesn’t isolate its contents from the surrounding text.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Using the <span class="kw">dir</span> attribute with <span class="kw">bdi</span></h3>
<p>The <span class="kw">dir</span> attribute can be used on the <span class="kw">bdi</span> element to set the base direction. With simple strings of text like PURPLE PIZZA you don’t really need it, however if your <span class="kw">bdi</span> element contains text that is itself bidirectional you’ll want to indicate the base direction.</p>
<p>Until now, you could only set the <span class="kw">dir</span> attribute to <span class="kw">ltr</span> or <span class="kw">rtl</span>.
  The problem is that in a situation such as the one described above, 
where you are pulling strings from a database or user, you may not know 
 which of these you need to use.</p>
<p>That’s why html5 has provided a new <span class="kw">auto</span> value for the <span class="kw">dir</span> attribute, and <span class="kw">bdi</span> comes with that set by default. The <span class="kw">auto</span>
 value tells the browser to look at the first strongly typed character 
in the element and work out from that what the base direction of the 
element should be. If it’s a Hebrew (or Arabic, etc.) character, the 
element will get a direction of rtl.  If it’s, say, a Latin character, 
the direction will be ltr.</p>
<p>There are some rare corner cases where this may not give the desired 
outcome, but in the vast majority of cases it should produce the 
expected result.</p>
<h3>Want another use case?</h3>
<p>Here’s another situation where <span class="kw">bdi</span> can be 
useful.  This time we are constructing multilingual breadcrumbs on the 
W3C i18n site. The page titles are generated by a script, and this page 
is in Hebrew, so the base direction is right-to-left.</p>
<p>Again here’s what you’d expect to see, and what you’d actually see.</p>
<div class="figure" style="width: 260px; float:left;text-align: center; margin-left: 7.5%; margin-right: 10px;">
<p><img src="r12a_blog_files/breadcrumbs-right.png" title="Articles &lt; Resources &lt; WERBEH" alt="Articles &lt; Resources &lt; WERBEH"></p><figcaption>What it should look like.</figcaption></div>
<div class="figure" style="width: 260px; float:left;text-align: center; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
<p><img src="r12a_blog_files/breadcrumbs-wrong.png" title="Resources &lt; Articles &lt; WERBEH" alt="Resources &lt; Articles &lt; WERBEH"></p><figcaption>What it actually looks like.</figcaption></div>
<p><br style="clear:both;"></p>
<p>Whereas in the previous example we were dealing with a number that 
was confused about its directionality, here we are dealing with a list 
of same script items in a base direction of the opposite direction. </p>
<p>If you wanted to generate markup that would produce the right 
ordering, whatever combination of titles was thrown at it, you could 
wrap each title in <span class="kw">bdi</span> elements.</p>
<h3>Want more information?</h3>
<p>The inclusion of these features has been championed by Aharon Lanin 
of Google within the W3C Internationalization (i18n) Working Group.  He 
is the editor of a W3C Working Draft, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/International/docs/html-bidi-requirements/">Additional Requirements for Bidi in HTML</a></cite>, that tracks a range of proposals made to the HTML5 Working Group, giving rationales and recording resolutions.  (The <span class="kw">bdi</span> element started out as a suggestion to include a <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/docs/html-bidi-requirements/#bidi-isolation">ubi attribute</a>.)</p>
<p>If you like more information on handling bidi in HTML in general, try <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/bidi-xhtml/">Creating HTML Pages in Arabic, Hebrew and Other Right-to-left Scripts</a></cite></p>
<p>And <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/text-level-semantics.html#the-bdi-element">here’s the description of <span class="kw">bdi</span></a> in the HTML5 spec.</p>

<p>The ‘i18n checker’ is a free service by the W3C that provides 
information about internationalization-related aspects of your HTML 
page, and advice on how to improve your use of markup, where needed, to 
support the multilingual Web.</p>
<p>This latest release uses a new user interface and redesigned source 
code. It also adds a number of new tests, a file upload facility, and 
support for HTML5.</p>
<p>This is still a ‘pre-final’ release and development continues. There 
are already plans to add further tests and features, to translate the 
user interface, to add support for XHTML5 and polyglot documents, to 
integrate with the W3C Unicorn checker, and to add various other 
features. At this stage we are particularly interested in receiving user
 feedback.</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/uniview/">&gt;&gt; Use UniView</a></p>
<p><strong>About the tool:</strong> Look up and see characters (using 
graphics or fonts) and property information, view whole character blocks
 or custom ranges, select characters to paste into your document, paste 
in and discover unknown characters, search for characters, do 
hex/dec/ncr conversions, highlight character types, etc. etc. Supports 
Unicode 6.0 and written with Web Standards to work on a variety of 
browsers. No need to install anything.</p>
<p><strong>Latest changes:</strong> The majority of changes in this update relate to the user interface. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many controls have been grouped under three tabs: Look up, Filter, 
and Options. Various previously dispersed controls were gathered 
together under the Filter and Options tabs. Many of the controls have 
been slightly renamed.</li>
<li>The Search control has been moved to the top right of the window, where it is always visible.</li>
<li>The old Text Area is now a Copy &amp; Paste control that has a 
2-dimensional input box. In browser such as Safari, Chrome and Firefox 
4, this box can be stretched by the user to whatever size is preferred.</li>
<li>The icon that provides a toggle switch between revealing detailed 
information for a character in a list or table, or copying that 
character to the Copy &amp; Paste box has been redesigned. It stands 
alone and indicates the location of the current outcome using arrows. <br>
                It looks like this: <img src="r12a_blog_files/clicktopanel.png" alt="with the two arrows" style="height: 2em; width: 2em;"> or this <img src="r12a_blog_files/clicktocparea.png" alt="with the two arrows" style="height: 2em; width: 2em;">.</li>
<li>Title text has been provided for all controls, describing briefly 
what that control does. You can see this information by hovering over 
the control with the mouse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these changes were introduced to make it a little easier for newcomers to get to grips with UniView.</p>
<p>There were also some feature changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‘Codepoints’ control was converted to accept text as well as 
code points and  renamed ‘Characters’.  By default the control expect 
hex code point values, but this can be switched using the radio buttons.
 For text, you would usually use the ‘Copy &amp; Paste’ control, but if 
you want to check out some characters without disturbing the contents of
 that control, you can now do so by setting the ‘Character’ radio button
 on the ‘Characters’ control.</li>
<li>The control to look up characters in the Unihan database <img src="r12a_blog_files/han.gif" alt="the icon that looks like a Japanese character">
 was fixed, but also extended to handle multiple characters at a time, 
opening a separate window for each character. (UniView warns you if you 
try to open more than 5 windows.)</li>
<li>The control to send characters to the Unicode Conversion tool <img src="r12a_blog_files/convert.png" alt="the icon with overlapping boxes">
 was fixed and now puts the character content of the  field in the green
 box of the Converter Tool. If you need to convert hex or decimal code 
point  values, do that in the converter.</li>
<li>The Show Age feature now works with lists, not just tables.</li>

	<p>It has always been possible to pass a string to <a href="http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/">the converter</a> in the URI, but that was never documented.</p>

 You can also pass a string with escapes in it, but you will need to be

<p>Inspired by some comments on John Well’s blog, I decided to add a 
keyboard layout to the IPA picker today.  It follows the layout of Mark 
Huckvale’s <a href="http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/phonetics/">Unicode Phonetic Keyboard</a> (UCL) v1.01.  </p>
<p>I can’t say I understand why many of the characters are allocated to 
the keys they are, but I figured that if John Wells uses this keyboard 
it would be probably worth using its layout.</p>

	<h2 class="post-title">New picker: Mongolian</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Sat 9 Oct 2010 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=pickers">pickers</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=mongolian">mongolian</a> &nbsp; </p>

<p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/pickers/mongolian/">&gt;&gt; Use it</a></p>
<p>This picker contains characters from the Unicode Mongolian block 
needed for writing the Mongolian language. It doesn’t include Sibe, Todo
 or Manchu characters. Mongolian is a complex script, and I am still 
familiarising myself with it. This is an initial trial version of a 
Mongolian picker, and as people use it and raise feedback I may need to 
make changes.</p>
<p><strong>About the tool:</strong> Pickers allow you to quickly create 
phrases in a script by clicking on Unicode characters arranged in a way 
that aids their identification. Pickers are likely to be most useful if 
you don’t know a script well enough to use the native keyboard. The 
arrangement of characters also makes it much more usable than a regular 
character map utility.</p>
<p><strong>About this picker:</strong> The output area for this picker 
is set up for vertical text. However, only Internet Explorer currently 
supports vertical text display, and only IE8 supports Mongolian’s 
left-to-right column progression. In addition, it seems that IE doesn’t 
support ltr columns in textarea elements. The bottom line is that, 
although the output area is the right shape and position for vertical 
text, mostly the output will be horizontal. You will see vertical text 
in IE, but the column positions will look wrong. Nevertheless, in any of
 these cases, when you cut and paste text into another document, the 
characters will still be correctly ordered.</p>
<p>Consonants are to the left, and in the order listed in the Wikipedia 
article about Mongolian text. To their right are vowels, then 
punctuation, spaces and control characters, and number digits. The 
variation selectors are positioned just below the consonants.</p>
<p>As you mouse over the letters, the various combining forms appear in a
 column to the far left. This is to help identify characters, for those 
less familiar with the alphabet.</p>

	<h2 class="post-title">What’s so difficult about jukugo ruby?</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Fri 24 Sep 2010 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=layout">layout</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=japanese">japanese</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>In this post I’m hoping to make clearer some of the concepts and 
issues surrounding jukugo ruby. If you don’t know what ruby is, see the 
article <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-ruby">Ruby</a> for a very quick introduction, or see <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/ruby/">Ruby Markup and Styling</a> for a slightly longer introduction to how it was expected to work in XHTML and CSS.</p>
<p>You can find an explanation of jukugo ruby in Requirements for Japanese Text Layout, sections <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-jlreq-20090604/#en-subheading2_3">3.3 Ruby and Emphasis Dots</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-jlreq-20090604/#en-app6">Appendix F Positioning of Jukugo-ruby</a> (you need to read both).</p>
<h3>What is jukugo ruby?</h3>
<p><dfn>Jukugo</dfn> refers to a Japanese compound noun, ie. a word made
 up of more than one kanji character. We are going to be talking here 
about how to mark up these jukugo words with ruby.</p>
<p>There are three types of ruby behaviour. </p>
<p><dfn>Mono ruby</dfn> is commonly used for phonetic annotation of 
text. In mono-ruby all the ruby text for a given character is positioned
 alongside a single base character, and doesn’t overlap adjacent base 
characters. Jukugo are often marked up using a mono-ruby approach. You 
can break a word that uses mono ruby at any point, and the ruby text 
just stays with the base character.</p>
<p><dfn>Group ruby</dfn> is often used where phonetic annotations don’t 
map to discreet base characters, or for semantic glosses that span the 
whole base text. You can’t split text that is annotated with group ruby.
 It has to wrap a single unit onto the next line.</p>
<p><dfn>Jukugo ruby</dfn> is a term that is used not to describe ruby 
annotations over jukugo text, but rather to describe ruby with a 
slightly different behaviour than mono or group ruby. Jukugo ruby 
behaves like mono ruby, in that there is a strong association between 
ruby text and individual base characters. This becomes clear when you 
split a word at the end of a line: you’ll see that the ruby text is 
split so that the ruby annotating a specific base character stays with 
that character.  What’s different about jukugo ruby is that when the 
word is NOT split at the end of the line, there can be some significant 
amount of overlap of ruby text with adjacent base characters.</p>
<p><img style="float:right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="r12a_blog_files/img2_3_4.png" alt="Example of ruby text."></p>
<p>The image to the right shows three examples of ruby annotating jukugo words. </p>
<p>In the top two examples, mono ruby can be used to produce the desired
 effect, since neither of the base characters are overlapped by ruby 
text that doesn’t relate to that character.</p>
<p>The third example is where we see the difference that is referred to as <span class="qterm">jukugo ruby</span>.
  The first three ruby characters are associated with the first kanji 
character. Just the last ruby character is associated with the second 
kanji character. And yet the ruby text has been arranged evenly across 
both kanji characters.</p>
<p>Note, however, that we aren’t simply spreading the ruby over the 
whole word, as we would with group ruby.  There are rules that apply, 
and in some cases gaps will appear.  See the following examples of 
distribution of ruby text over jukugo words.</p>
<p><img src="r12a_blog_files/img_a6_3.png" style="margin:auto;" alt="Various examples of jukugo ruby."></p>
<p>In the next part of this post I will look at some of the problems encountered when trying to use HTML and CSS for jukugo ruby.</p>

	<h2 class="post-title">String analyser and conversion apps updated</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Sun 22 Aug 2010 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=converter">converter</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>Analyser: <a href="http://rishida.net/tools/analysestring/">http://rishida.net/tools/analysestring/</a></p>
<p>Converter: <a href="http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/">http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/</a></p>
<p>The <b class"noticeme">string analyser tool</b> provides 
information about the characters in a string. One difference in this 
version is a new section “Data input as graphics”, where you see a 
horizontal sequence of graphics for each of the characters in the string
 you are analysing. This can be useful to get a screen snap of the 
characters.  Of course, there is no combining or ligaturing behaviour 
involved – just a graphic per character.</p>
<p>You can reverse the character order for right-to-left scripts.</p>
<p>Another difference is that you can explode example text in the notes.  Take <a href="http://rishida.net/tools/analysestring/index.php?list=%D8%A2">this example</a>:
 if you click on the Arabic word for Koran (red word near the bottom of 
the notes), you’ll see a pop-up window in the bottom right corner of the
 window that lists the characters in that word.</p>
<p>The other change is that the former “Related links” section in the 
sidebar is now called “Do more”, and the links carry the string you are 
analysing to the Converter or UniView apps.</p>
<p>Oh, and the page now remembers the options you set between refreshes, which makes life much easier.</p>
<p>The <b class="noticeme">converter</b> tool converts between 
characters and various escaped character formats.  It was changed so 
that the “View names” button sends the characters to the string analyser
 tool.  This means that you’ll now see graphics for the characters, and 
that, once on the string analyser page, you can change the amount of 
information displayed for each character (including showing font-based 
characters, if you need to).</p>
<p>I also fixed a bug related to the UTF-8 and UTF-16 input.  Including spaces after the code values no longer fires off a bug.</p>
<p><i class="footnote">PS: The string analyser tool has graphics for all
 new Unicode 6.0 characters, however I haven’t updated the data for 
those characters yet.  I was planning to do so with the next release of 
UniView, which should be in October, when the final Unicode database is 
available.</i></p>

 wrote the article, it was hard to find fonts for those scripts.</p>
<p>I also added a new feature: In the HTML version, click on any of the

lists the characters in order, with Unicode names, and shows the 
characters themselves as graphics.</p>
<p>I have not yet updated this article’s incarnation as <a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn10/">Unicode Technical Note #10</a>.  The Indian Government also used this article, and made a number of small changes.  I have yet to incorporate those, too.</p>

 Here are some notes that may help to clarify the situation.  They are 
not fully developed! Just rough jottings, but they may be of use.</p>
<p>Let’s assume, for the sake of an example, that the goal is to display
 a page in Hindi, which is written using the devanagari script. These 
principles, however, apply to one degree or another to all languages 
that use characters outside the ASCII range.</p>
<p>Let’s start by reviewing some fundamental concepts: character 
encodings and fonts.  If you are familiar with these concepts, skip to 
the next heading.</p>
<h4>Character encodings and fonts</h4>
<p>Content is composed of a sequence of <em>characters</em>. Characters 
represent letters of the alphabet, punctuation, etc. But content is 
stored in a computer as a sequence of bytes, which are numeric values. 
Sometimes more than one byte is used to represent a single character. 
Like codes used in espionage, the way that the sequence of bytes is 
converted to characters depends on what <em>key</em> was used to encode the text. In this context, that key is called a <em>character encoding</em>.</p>
<p>There are many character encodings to choose from.</p>
<p>The person who created the content of the page you want to read 
should have used a character encoding that supports devanagari 
characters, but it should also be a character encoding that is widely 
recognised by browsers and available in editors. By far the best 
character encoding to use (for any language in the world) is called 
UTF-8.  </p>
<p>UTF-8 is strongly recommended by the HTML5 draft specification.</p>
<p>There should be a <em>character encoding declaration</em> associated 
with the HTML code of your page to say what encoding was used.  
Otherwise the browser may not interpret the bytes correctly. It is also 
crucial that the text is actually <em>stored</em> in that encoding too. 
 That means that the person creating the content must choose that 
encoding when they save the page from their editor.  It’s not possible 
to change the encoding of text simply by changing the character encoding
 declaration in the HTML code, because the declaration is there just to 
indicate to the browser what key to use to get at the already encoded 
text.</p>
<p>It’s one thing for the browser to know how to interpret the bytes to 
represent your text, but the browser must also have a way to make those 
characters stored in memory appear on the screen.</p>
<p>A font is essential here. Fonts contain instructions for displaying a
 character or a sequence of characters so that you can read them.  The 
visual representation of a character is called a glyph. The font 
converts characters to glyphs. </p>
<p>The font has tables to map the bytes in memory to text. To do this, 
the font needs to recognise the character encoding your page uses, and 
have the necessary tables to convert the characters to glyphs.  It is 
important that the font used can work with the character encoding used 
in the page you want to view.  Most fonts these days support UTF-8 
encoded text.</p>
<p>Very simple fonts contain one glyph for each letter of the alphabet. 
 This may work for English, but it wouldn’t work for a complex script 
such as devanagari.  In these scripts the positioning and interaction of
 characters has to be modified according to the context in which they 
are displayed.  This means that the font needs additional information 
about how to choose and postion glyphs depending on the context.  That 
information may be built into the font itself, or the font may rely on 
information on your system.</p>
<h4>Character encoding support</h4>
<p>The browser needs to be able to recognise the character encoding used
 in order to correctly interpret the mapping between bytes and 
characters.</p>
<p>If the character encoding of the page is incorrectly declared, or not
 declared at all, there will be problems viewing the content. Typically,
 a browser allows the user to manually apply a particular encoding by 
selecting the encoding from the menu bar.</p>
<p>All browsers should support the UTF-8 character encoding.  </p>
<p>Sometimes people use an encoding that is not designed for devanagari 
support with a font that produces the right glyphs nevertheless.  Such 
approaches are fraught with issues and present poor interoperability on 
several levels. For example, the content can only be interpreted 
correctly by applying the specifically designed font; no other font will
 do if that font is not available. Also, the meaning of the text cannot 
be derived by machine processing, for web searches, etc., and the data 
cannot be easily copied or merged with other text (eg. to quote a 
sentence in another article that doesn’t use the same encoding). This 
practise seriously damages the openness of the Web and should be avoided
 at all costs.</p>
<h4>System font support</h4>
<p>Usually, a web page will rely on the operating system to provide a 
devanagari font.  If there isn’t one, users won’t be able to see the 
Hindi text.  The browser doesn’t supply the font, it picks it up from 
whatever platform the browser is running on.</p>
<p>If browser is running on a desktop computer, there may be a font 
already installed. If not, it should be possible to download free or 
commercial fonts and install them. If the user is viewing the page on a 
mobile device, it may currently be difficult to download and install 
one.</p>
<p>If there are several devanagari fonts on a system, the browser will 
usually pick one by default.  However, if the web page uses CSS to apply
 styling to the page, the CSS code may specify one or more particular 
fonts to use for a given piece of content. If none of these are 
available on the system, most browsers will fall back to the default, 
however Internet Explorer will show square boxes instead.</p>
<h4>Webfonts</h4>
<p>Another way of getting a font onto the user’s system is to download 
it with the page, just like images are downloaded with the page.  This 
is done using CSS code. The CSS code to do this has been defined for 
some years, but unfortunately most browsers  implementation of this 
feature is still problematic.</p>
<p>Recently a number of major browsers have begun to support download of
 raw truetype or opentype fonts. Internet Explorer is not one of those. 
This involves simply loading the ordinary font onto a server and 
downloading to the browser when the page is displayed. Although the font
 may be cached as the user moves from page to page, there may still be 
some significant issues when dealing with complex scripts or Far Eastern
 languages (such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean) due to the size of the
 fonts used. The size of these fonts can often be counted in megabytes 
rather than kilobytes.</p>
<p>It is important to observe licencing restrictions when making fonts 
available for download in this way. The CSS mechanism doesn’t contain 
any restrictions related to font licences, but there are ways of 
preparing fonts for download that take into consideration some aspects 
of this issue – though not enough to provide a watertight restriction on
 font usage. </p>
<p>Microsoft makes available a program to create .eot fonts from 
ordinary true/opentype fonts. Eot font files can apply some usage 
restrictions and also subset the font to include only the characters 
used on the page.  The subsetting feature is useful when only a small 
amount of text appears in a given font, but for a whole page in, say, 
devanagari script it is of little use – particularly if the user is to 
input text in forms.  The biggest problem with .eot files, however, is 
that they are only supported by Internet Explorer, and there are no 
plans to support .eot format on other browsers.</p>
<p>The W3C is currently working on the WOFF format. Fonts converted to 
WOFF format can have some gentle protection with regard to use, and also
 apply significant compression to the font being downloaded.  WOFF is 
currently only supported by Firefox, but all other major browsers are 
expected to provide support for the new format.</p>
<p>For this to work well, all browsers must support the same type of font download.</p>
<h4>Beyond fonts</h4>
<p>Complex scripts, such as those used for Indic and South East Asian 
languages, need to choose glyph shapes and positions and substitute 
ligatures, etc. according to the context in which characters are used. 
These adjustments can be acoomplished using the features of OpenType 
fonts.  The browser must be able to implement those opentype features.</p>
<p>Often a font will also rely on operating system support for some 
subset of the complex script rendering.  For example, a devanagari font 
may rely on the Windows uniscribe dll for things like positioning of 
left-appended vowel signs, rather than encoding that behaviour into the 
font itself.  This reduces the size and complexity of the font, but 
exposes a problem when using that font on a variety of platforms.  
Unless the operating system can provide the same rendering support, the 
text will look only partially correct. Mobile devices must either 
provide something similar to uniscribe, or fonts used on the mobile 
device must include all needed rendering features.</p>
<p>Browsers that do font linking must also support the necessary 
opentype features and obtain functionality from the OS rendering support
 where needed.</p>
<p>If tools are developed to subset webfonts, the subsetting must not 
remove the rendering logic needed for correct display of the text.</p>

			<p>“By far the best character encoding to use (for any language in the world) is called UTF-8.”</p>
<p>This is surely true for scripts using characters with codepoints below U+0800. However, a CJK character takes 3 bytes in UTF-8, but only 2 bytes in UTF-16, so UTF-8 might not always be the best option for _any_ language.</p>
<p>Of course, the context here is Web pages, where the markup syntax adds Basic Latin characters (1 byte in UTF-8, 2 bytes in UTF-16). This shifts the balance even for pages in Far Eastern languages towards UTF-8.</p>
<p>BTW, there’s a typo: acoomplished</p>

<p>A very helpful summary of the complex language support ecosystem.  The Web Foundation is interested in raising awareness of these challenges, and doing what we can to make it easier for more people to author and read in more languages.</p>
<p>Have you found any good references that summarize the challenges faced by, say, the worlds 500 (or whatever) most spoken or most read languages?</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you on these issues.</p>

			<p>@Steve, I don’t know of a single, comprehensive source that describes the technical issues on the ground, such as what is/isn’t supported by what platform, though it would certainly be interesting to work on such a thing.</p>
<p>Some information can be gleaned from Don Osborne’s new book “African Languages in a Digital Age” and the reports by the PAN Localization project in Asia.</p>
<p>However, for a pretty good overview of the basic features of the main scripts in use around the world (which is a good starting point), come and see my tutorial at the Unicode Conference in October, or read the online text at <a href="http://rishida.net/docs/unicode-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">http://rishida.net/docs/unicode-tutorial/</a></p>

	<h2 class="post-title">New picker: Lisu (Fraser script)</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Sun 23 May 2010 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=pickers">pickers</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=lisu">lisu</a> &nbsp; </p>

<p class="floatright"><a href="http://rishida.net/blog/images/lisupicker10.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/lisupicker10-small.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></p>
<p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/pickers/lisu/">&gt;&gt; Use it</a></p>
<p>In 1992 the Chinese government recognised the Fraser alphabet as the 
official script for the Lisu language and has encouraged its use since 
then. There are 630,000 Lisu people in China, mainly in the regions of 
Nujiang, Diqing, Lijiang, Dehong, Baoshan, Kunming and Chuxiong in the 
Yunnan Province. Another 350,000 Lisu live in Myanmar, Thailand and 
India. Other user communities are mostly Christians from the Dulong, the
 Nu and the Bai nationalities in China.</p>
<p><strong>About the tool:</strong> Pickers allow you to quickly create 
phrases in a script by clicking on Unicode characters arranged in a way 
that aids their identification. Pickers are likely to be most useful if 
you don’t know a script well enough to use the native keyboard. The 
arrangement of characters also makes it much more usable than a regular 
character map utility.</p>
<p><strong>Latest changes:</strong> This picker is new. The default view
 was modified from an original proposal by Benjamin Lee, and is likely 
to be more useful to people who are somewhat familiar with the alphabet 
and characters of Lisu. Characters are arranged to simplify entry, with 
consonants to the left, vowels to their right, and tone marks to their 
right.</p>
<p>There is also a keyboard view.  Many of the positions of characters 
are based on keyboard layouts I have seen. Those keyboards, however, 
tended to use some ASCII characters for punctuation, when the Unicode 
Standard recommends other characters (in particular, MODIFIER LETTER LOW
 MACRON and MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE) or omit some punctuation 
characters mentioned in the Unicode Standard. The current version of 
this keyboard, therefore adds some extra characters.</p>
<p>The layout is adequate, given that pickers assume availability of a 
QWERTY keyboard, however if a real standardised keyboard layout is to be
 made, it should involve some further changes. For example, people 
wanting to use syntax characters such as comma, period, semi-colon, 
single quote, etc, while writing the text in Lisu will need direct 
access to those characters. They are missing from this layout.</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/uniview/">&gt;&gt; Use UniView</a></p>
<p><strong>About the tool:</strong> Look up and see characters (using 
graphics or fonts) and property information, view whole character blocks
 or custom ranges, select characters to paste into your document, paste 
in and discover unknown characters, search for characters, do 
hex/dec/ncr conversions, highlight character types, etc. etc. Supports 
Unicode 5.2 and written with Web Standards to work on a variety of 
browsers. No need to install anything.</p>
<p><strong>Latest changes:</strong> The major change in this update is 
the addition of an alternative UniView lite interface for the tool that 
makes it easier to use UniView in restricted screen sizes, such as on 
mobile devices. The lite interface offers a subset of the functionality 
provided in the full version, rearranges the user interface and sets up 
some different defaults (eg. list view is the default, rather than the 
matrix view). However, the underlying code is the same – only the 
initial markup and the CSS are different.</p>
<p>Another significant change is that when you click on a character in a
 list or matrix that character is either added to the text area or 
detailed information for that character is displayed, but not now both 
at the same time. You switch between the two possibilities by clicking 
on the <img src="r12a_blog_files/pickeroff-long.png" title="Toggle to copy characters to the character area or not"> icon. When the background is white (default) details are shown for the character. When the background is orange <img src="r12a_blog_files/pickeron-long.png" title="Toggle to copy characters to the character area or not"> the character will be added to the text area (like a character map or picker).</p>
<p>Information from my character database is now shown by default when 
you are shown detailed information for a character. The switch to 
disable this has been moved to the <span class="onscreen">Options</span> panel.</p>
<p style="">Text highlighted in red in information from the character 
database contains examples. In case you don’t have a font for viewing 
such examples, or in case you just want to better understand the 
component characters, you can now click on these and the component 
characters will be listed in a new window (using the <a href="http://rishida.net/rishida/tools/analysestring/">String Analyzer</a> tool).</p>
<p>Access to <span class="onscreen">Settings</span> panel has been moved slightly downwards and renamed <span class="onscreen">Options</span> in the full version.</p>
<p>The default order for items in lists is now 
&lt;character&gt;&lt;codepoint&gt;&lt;name&gt;, rather than the previous
 &lt;codepoint&gt;&lt;character&gt;&lt;name&gt;. This can still be 
changed in the <span class="onscreen">Options</span> panel, or by setting query parameters.</p>
<p>I changed the <span class="onscreen">Next</span> and <span class="onscreen">Previous</span>
 functions in the character detail pane so that it moves one codepoint 
at a time through the Unicode encoding space. The controls are now 
buttons rather than images.</p>
